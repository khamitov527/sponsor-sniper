[0.3s - 3.8s]: welcome to the huberman Lab podcast
[2.2s - 5.7s]: where we discuss science and
[3.8s - 8.2s]: science-based tools for everyday
[5.7s - 10.6s]: [Music]
[8.2s - 12.3s]: life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a
[10.6s - 14.3s]: professor of neurobiology and
[12.3s - 16.5s]: Opthalmology at Stanford School of
[14.3s - 19.3s]: Medicine my guest today is Dr Chris
[16.5s - 21.7s]: Palmer Dr Chris Palmer is a psychiatrist
[19.3s - 23.8s]: and researcher at Harvard University he
[21.7s - 26.0s]: focuses on how metabolic health and
[23.8s - 27.9s]: mitochondrial Health in particular can
[26.0s - 30.3s]: be leveraged to treat and in some cases
[27.9s - 33.4s]: cure psychiatric disorders including
[30.3s - 36.2s]: schizophrenia autism depression bipolar
[33.4s - 37.6s]: and ADHD today we discuss how metabolic
[36.2s - 40.1s]: Health something we hear a lot about
[37.6s - 42.1s]: nowadays is really about mitochondrial
[40.1s - 43.7s]: health and the specific lifestyle and
[42.1s - 45.5s]: other factors that you can use to
[43.7s - 47.6s]: improve mitochondrial number and
[45.5s - 49.3s]: function we talk about things like
[47.6s - 51.1s]: exercise sleep sunlight which you've
[49.3s - 53.1s]: heard about before but we talk about
[51.1s - 54.5s]: those from a different perspective and
[53.1s - 56.6s]: we discuss some things that have never
[54.5s - 58.6s]: been discussed before on this podcast at
[56.6s - 61.4s]: least in light of mitochondrial health
[58.6s - 63.2s]: things such as creatine methylene blue
[61.4s - 65.8s]: nicotine and we talk about the key role
[63.2s - 67.6s]: of specific B vitamins and iron in brain
[65.8s - 69.7s]: function we also have a very direct
[67.6s - 71.9s]: discussion about vaccines and whether or
[69.7s - 73.9s]: not inflammation caused by vaccines can
[71.9s - 76.0s]: potentially damage mitochondria which
[73.9s - 78.0s]: then leads to mental health challenges
[76.0s - 80.6s]: and of course in that context we discuss
[78.0s - 82.2s]: the vaccine autism debate we also
[80.6s - 84.1s]: discuss public health and what is needed
[82.2s - 85.8s]: to truly change the way people exercise
[84.1s - 87.6s]: and eat and the rapidly changing
[85.8s - 90.2s]: landscape of the National Institutes of
[87.6s - 92.5s]: Health and the CDC as you'll soon hear
[90.2s - 94.1s]: Dr Palmer gives us a master class on
[92.5s - 96.4s]: mitochondrial function and how to
[94.1s - 97.8s]: improve this vital aspect of our health
[96.4s - 99.7s]: if you've heard about metabolic Health
[97.8s - 101.7s]: you've heard about the Obesity crisis
[99.7s - 103.5s]: that's important but looking at all of
[101.7s - 105.1s]: that and approaching it through the lens
[103.5s - 108.1s]: of mitochondrial Health you'll soon
[105.1s - 109.7s]: learn is absolutely the way to go it's a
[108.1s - 111.2s]: New Perspective that will change the way
[109.7s - 113.1s]: that you think about mental and physical
[111.2s - 115.3s]: health and that no doubt will impact
[113.1s - 117.4s]: your health practices in very positive
[115.3s - 119.1s]: ways before we begin I'd like to
[117.4s - 120.5s]: emphasize that this podcast is separate
[119.1s - 122.9s]: from my teaching and research roles at
[120.5s - 124.3s]: Stanford it is however part of my desire
[122.9s - 126.2s]: and effort to bring zero cost to
[124.3s - 128.0s]: Consumer information about science and
[126.2s - 130.2s]: science related tools to the general
[128.0s - 132.8s]: public in keeping with that theme this
[130.2s - 136.0s]: episode does include sponsors and now
[132.8s - 138.8s]: for my discussion with Dr Chris Palmer
[136.0s - 141.4s]: Dr Chris Palmer welcome back thank you
[138.8s - 143.0s]: so much for having me back I credit you
[141.4s - 147.2s]: with leading
[143.0s - 149.2s]: the Call to Arms the public awareness
[147.2s - 152.3s]: and the implementation of what some
[149.2s - 154.8s]: people call medic olic Psychiatry but
[152.3s - 156.6s]: what we could easily just call the
[154.8s - 160.6s]: relationship between mental and physical
[156.6s - 163.1s]: health and the use of nutrition
[160.6s - 164.9s]: supplementation and where appropriate
[163.1s - 167.5s]: prescription drugs for the treatment of
[164.9s - 170.2s]: mental health but what do you call this
[167.5s - 172.4s]: field that you've basically founded and
[170.2s - 175.2s]: that you're pioneering there are others
[172.4s - 176.5s]: right but uh that you're pioneering and
[175.2s - 178.2s]: how should the general public think
[176.5s - 180.4s]: about the relationship between
[178.2s - 183.9s]: mitochondria and their Mental Health for
[180.4s - 186.3s]: for those that are not aware educate us
[183.9s - 189.6s]: I could talk for hours on this um so
[186.3s - 191.5s]: first of all thank you for um I I think
[189.6s - 194.0s]: you're actually giving me way too much
[191.5s - 196.3s]: credit though um I don't know about that
[194.0s - 199.6s]: I uh I'm I'm talking a lot about it and
[196.3s - 201.3s]: I think I will accept that maybe I'm
[199.6s - 203.8s]: able to talk about it in a way that
[201.3s - 207.8s]: helps people understand it that other
[203.8s - 210.3s]: scientists haven't been able to
[207.8s - 212.5s]: but you know one of the more important
[210.3s - 214.2s]: reasons I want to say this is because
[212.5s - 216.6s]: unbeknownst to a lot of people this
[214.2s - 218.1s]: field has actually been around for about
[216.6s - 221.3s]: a century and a
[218.1s - 222.4s]: half researchers in the 1800s around the
[221.3s - 225.0s]: turn of the
[222.4s - 228.2s]: century well up into the
[225.0s - 231.0s]: 1960s were hyperfocused on the role of
[228.2s - 233.4s]: metabolism in severe mental illness
[231.0s - 236.0s]: schizophrenia bipolar disorder they were
[233.4s - 240.1s]: actually measuring levels of lactate and
[236.0s - 242.1s]: glucose and um and other kind of metabol
[240.1s - 244.7s]: biomarkers in people with schizophrenia
[242.1s - 249.1s]: and bipolar disorder documenting
[244.7s - 251.6s]: differences really kind of H honi in on
[249.1s - 254.2s]: the these metabolic disruptions is
[251.6s - 257.7s]: potentially the cause of mental
[254.2s - 260.9s]: illness and then our field lost its way
[257.7s - 263.1s]: we we became focused on
[260.9s - 266.1s]: neurotransmitters and assumed that they
[263.1s - 268.5s]: were the primary cause of mental
[266.1s - 270.5s]: illness while other fields were focused
[268.5s - 272.7s]: on psychological and social social
[270.5s - 274.5s]: factors you know we got cognitive
[272.7s - 275.8s]: behavioral therapy we still had
[274.5s - 277.9s]: psychodynamic
[275.8s - 279.8s]: Psychotherapy um but people were doing
[277.9s - 282.8s]: research on adverse childhood
[279.8s - 286.0s]: experiences that was really taking off
[282.8s - 288.8s]: documenting that that's related and
[286.0s - 291.1s]: so you know the field kind of splintered
[288.8s - 292.1s]: into these biological psychological
[291.1s - 295.2s]: social
[292.1s - 297.6s]: camps um and people really hyperfocused
[295.2s - 302.8s]: in all of these
[297.6s - 305.8s]: ways to me this field of integrating
[302.8s - 306.8s]: metabolism with mental health with
[305.8s - 309.3s]: physical
[306.8s - 311.6s]: health is about
[309.3s - 315.3s]: unifying that whole
[311.6s - 317.9s]: story it's about unifying and building
[315.3s - 319.5s]: on what these researchers a hundred
[317.9s - 322.0s]: years ago were
[319.5s - 324.2s]: pursuing it's about integrating the
[322.0s - 327.5s]: biological psychological and social
[324.2s - 330.9s]: camps it's about putting it all together
[327.5s - 333.2s]: and stop being so reductive C istic and
[330.9s - 335.5s]: simplistic to suggest that it's all
[333.2s - 337.8s]: biological or it's all psychological or
[335.5s - 339.9s]: it's all social and that if one if it's
[337.8s - 342.1s]: one it can't be the other it can be all
[339.9s - 344.0s]: of them um and it's different
[342.1s - 347.4s]: combinations for different
[344.0s - 350.2s]: people so in many
[347.4s - 353.7s]: ways I'm just standing on the shoulders
[350.2s - 356.3s]: of giants who have done groundbreaking
[353.7s - 360.6s]: work to create the science that allows
[356.3s - 364.3s]: us to put this all together um
[360.6s - 366.2s]: with that said I do firmly believe that
[364.3s - 370.9s]: we are on the cusp
[366.2s - 373.5s]: of a revolutionary change in the
[370.9s - 375.7s]: Paradigm of the mental health field of
[373.5s - 377.8s]: how we think about mental
[375.7s - 381.7s]: illness you
[377.8s - 383.8s]: know there are Myriad biological
[381.7s - 385.8s]: things the psychological and social
[383.8s - 388.1s]: things are all obvious and true yes
[385.8s - 390.0s]: stress trauma loneliness adverse
[388.1s - 391.8s]: childhood experiences all of those
[390.0s - 394.0s]: things come
[391.8s - 395.4s]: together our field is long known that
[394.0s - 397.9s]: all of those things play a role in
[395.4s - 400.2s]: mental illness which exactly which
[397.9s - 403.7s]: mental illnesses it's essentially all of
[400.2s - 407.2s]: them every one of the labels in
[403.7s - 409.9s]: dsm5 can be impacted by biological
[407.2s - 411.2s]: psychological and social factors so
[409.9s - 413.4s]: trauma in
[411.2s - 416.0s]: childhood increases risk for
[413.4s - 418.8s]: posttraumatic stress disorder duh
[416.0s - 421.4s]: everybody knows that trauma in childhood
[418.8s - 423.2s]: also increases risk for
[421.4s - 426.6s]: neurodevelopmental disorders if it
[423.2s - 428.9s]: occurs early enough it increases risk
[426.6s - 430.8s]: for substance use disorders personality
[428.9s - 434.0s]: disorders psychotic disorders mood
[430.8s - 438.6s]: disorders anxiety disorders dementia
[434.0s - 441.5s]: later in life and everything else every
[438.6s - 444.1s]: label what else do adverse childhood
[441.5s - 447.3s]: experiences increase risk for all of the
[444.1s - 449.6s]: metabolic disorders obesity type 2
[447.3s - 452.5s]: diabetes cardiovascular disease
[449.6s - 455.0s]: autoimmune disorders premature
[452.5s - 457.7s]: mortality you know we have statistics
[455.0s - 459.6s]: that just sticking with that theme
[457.7s - 463.2s]: adverse childhood experiences if you
[459.6s - 465.7s]: have six or more adverse childhood
[463.2s - 467.9s]: experiences compared to somebody who has
[465.7s - 471.5s]: no adverse childhood experiences now
[467.9s - 473.6s]: that's a rare group granted but for the
[471.5s - 475.7s]: people who have six or more on average
[473.6s - 481.1s]: they live 20
[475.7s - 484.5s]: years shorter they lose 20 years of life
[481.1s - 486.9s]: because of those adverse childhood
[484.5s - 489.1s]: experiences and so is that a mental
[486.9s - 492.4s]: health issue I would say it's a physical
[489.1s - 493.8s]: health issue it's both it's both a
[492.4s - 495.3s]: mental health issue and a physical
[493.8s - 497.2s]: health issue and so how can we
[495.3s - 500.6s]: understand that how can we understand
[497.2s - 504.0s]: that trauma in childhood increases risk
[500.6s - 508.9s]: for heart disease and obesity and
[504.0s - 511.7s]: diabetes and dementia and PTSD and ADHD
[508.9s - 512.8s]: and sub use disorders and the only way
[511.7s - 515.1s]: to connect
[512.8s - 517.8s]: it is through
[515.1s - 520.4s]: metabolism and ultimately through
[517.8s - 522.4s]: mitochondria unfortunately people like
[520.4s - 524.0s]: simple answers and they're like so diet
[522.4s - 526.1s]: will fix everything I'm like no I never
[524.0s - 529.8s]: said diet will fix everything but it can
[526.1s - 532.8s]: help it can help and it can be
[529.8s - 535.8s]: lifechanging and life saving I I don't
[532.8s - 538.8s]: want to I don't want to minimize or step
[535.8s - 540.3s]: back from my work with dietary
[538.8s - 543.1s]: intervention
[540.3s - 546.0s]: there is no doubt in my mind it can
[543.1s - 549.8s]: dramatically change people's
[546.0s - 552.6s]: lives but it's not just diet it's lots
[549.8s - 554.7s]: of other things and um and so it's
[552.6s - 557.3s]: putting it together and trying to make
[554.7s - 559.8s]: sense of the science for what does
[557.3s - 561.5s]: cardiovascular disease have to do with
[559.8s - 564.5s]: depression or
[561.5s - 565.9s]: PTSD on the surface a lot of people
[564.5s - 568.0s]: scratch their heads and they really
[565.9s - 569.8s]: don't know they they assume that well
[568.0s - 572.6s]: one's a brain disorder and one a heart
[569.8s - 575.3s]: disorder and it's like no we need to
[572.6s - 579.1s]: integrate that because all of the risk
[575.3s - 581.4s]: factors this this essentially the same
[579.1s - 583.5s]: bioc psychosocial risk factors that
[581.4s - 586.8s]: increase risk for heart disease also
[583.5s - 588.5s]: increase risk for brain disease and we
[586.8s - 589.6s]: just we need to start putting it
[588.5s - 591.7s]: together we need to be more
[589.6s - 595.7s]: sophisticated we have computers we have
[591.7s - 597.8s]: ai it's 2025 we can do better yes well
[595.7s - 600.2s]: first of all uh I and I'm sure the
[597.8s - 603.2s]: listeners really appreciate your human
[600.2s - 605.4s]: regarding who's responsible for the uh
[603.2s - 608.2s]: big surge in uh the interest in this
[605.4s - 610.0s]: field um so thanks for crediting your
[608.2s - 613.2s]: predecessors and um the others in the
[610.0s - 616.4s]: field uh at the same time I credit you
[613.2s - 618.0s]: um with really popularizing a lot of
[616.4s - 619.8s]: these terms being willing to go public
[618.0s - 622.2s]: facing and and share about metabolic
[619.8s - 626.1s]: Psychiatry for lack of a better uh way
[622.2s - 628.7s]: to put it U metabolic Psychiatry and and
[626.1s - 631.0s]: and really championing these ideas and
[628.7s - 633.5s]: uh being open into being part of a
[631.0s - 636.4s]: medical and Science and public discourse
[633.5s - 637.8s]: community so I'd be remiss if I didn't
[636.4s - 640.4s]: say that so hopefully you'll take that
[637.8s - 642.4s]: in and if you won't then I I very much
[640.4s - 644.2s]: appreciate it it's true thank you very
[642.4s - 645.1s]: much it's true and and I'm not alone in
[644.2s - 647.3s]: in that
[645.1s - 649.8s]: sentiment I'd like to take a quick break
[647.3s - 651.8s]: and acknowledge our sponsor our place
[649.8s - 654.3s]: our place makes my favorite pots pans
[651.8s - 656.5s]: and other cookware surprisingly toxic
[654.3s - 658.8s]: compounds such as pases or forever
[656.5s - 661.1s]: chemicals are still found in 80% of
[658.8s - 662.9s]: non-stick pans as well as utensils
[661.1s - 664.9s]: appliances and countless other Kitchen
[662.9s - 667.7s]: products as I've discussed on this
[664.9s - 669.8s]: podcast these pases or forever chemicals
[667.7s - 671.7s]: like Teflon have been linked to major
[669.8s - 673.9s]: health issues such as hormone disruption
[671.7s - 676.3s]: gut microbiome disruption fertility
[673.9s - 678.4s]: issues and many other health concerns so
[676.3s - 680.8s]: it's really important to avoid them this
[678.4s - 682.2s]: is why I'm a huge fan of ourplace
[680.8s - 684.0s]: ourplace products are made with the
[682.2s - 687.2s]: highest quality materials and are all
[684.0s - 689.8s]: past and toxin-free I particularly love
[687.2s - 691.5s]: their titanium always pan Pro it's the
[689.8s - 694.1s]: first non-stick pan made with zero
[691.5s - 696.2s]: chemicals and zero coating instead it's
[694.1s - 698.4s]: pure titanium this means it has no
[696.2s - 700.4s]: harmful forever chemical and that it
[698.4s - 702.7s]: doesn't degrade or lose its non-stick
[700.4s - 704.9s]: effect over time it's also beautiful to
[702.7s - 707.6s]: look at I cook eggs in my titanium
[704.9s - 709.1s]: always pan Pro almost every morning the
[707.6s - 710.9s]: design allows for the eggs to cook
[709.1s - 713.2s]: perfectly and without sticking to the
[710.9s - 714.6s]: pan I also cook burgers and steaks in it
[713.2s - 716.9s]: and it puts a really nice sear on the
[714.6s - 718.4s]: meat but again nothing sticks to it so
[716.9s - 720.7s]: it's really easy to clean and even
[718.4s - 723.0s]: dishwasher safe I love it and I use it
[720.7s - 725.4s]: constantly our place now has a full line
[723.0s - 727.4s]: of Titanium Pro cookware that uses this
[725.4s - 729.0s]: firstof its- kind titanium non-stick
[727.4s - 731.6s]: technology so if you're looking for
[729.0s - 733.3s]: non-toxic long-lasting pots and pans go

[749.5s - 753.9s]: episode is also brought To Us by element
[752.0s - 755.4s]: element is an electrolyte drink that has
[753.9s - 757.7s]: everything you need but nothing you
[755.4s - 759.4s]: don't that means the electrolytes sodium
[757.7s - 761.7s]: magnesium and potassium all in the
[759.4s - 763.5s]: correct ratios but no sugar proper
[761.7s - 765.7s]: hydration is critical for optimal brain
[763.5s - 767.6s]: and body function even a slight degree
[765.7s - 769.5s]: of dehydration can diminish cognitive
[767.6s - 770.6s]: and physical performance it's also
[769.5s - 772.5s]: important that you get adequate
[770.6s - 774.6s]: electrolytes the electrolytes sodium
[772.5s - 776.1s]: magnesium and potassium are vital for
[774.6s - 778.0s]: the functioning of all the cells in your
[776.1s - 779.9s]: body especially your neurons or your
[778.0s - 781.4s]: nerve cells drinking element dissolved
[779.9s - 783.0s]: in water makes it extremely easy to
[781.4s - 785.3s]: ensure that you're getting adequate
[783.0s - 786.5s]: hydration and adequate electrolytes to
[785.3s - 788.6s]: make sure that I'm getting proper
[786.5s - 790.4s]: amounts of hydration and electrolytes I
[788.6s - 792.5s]: dissolve one packet of element in about
[790.4s - 793.9s]: 16 to 32 ounces of water when I wake up
[792.5s - 795.6s]: in the morning and I drink that
[793.9s - 797.2s]: basically first thing in the morning I
[795.6s - 798.9s]: also drink element dissolved in water
[797.2s - 800.8s]: during any kind of physical exercise
[798.9s - 802.5s]: that I'm doing especially on hot days
[800.8s - 804.8s]: when I'm sweating a lot and therefore
[802.5s - 805.8s]: losing a lot of water and electrolytes
[804.8s - 808.0s]: they have a bunch of different great
[805.8s - 810.3s]: tasting flavors of element they have
[808.0s - 812.3s]: watermelon citrus Etc frankly I love
[810.3s - 815.3s]: them all if you'd like to try element
[812.3s - 817.1s]: you can go to drink element.com huberman
[815.3s - 819.3s]: to claim a free element sample pack with
[817.1s - 822.2s]: the purchase of any element drink mix
[819.3s - 824.1s]: again that's drink element.com huberman
[822.2s - 828.0s]: to claim a free sample
[824.1s - 830.1s]: pack if I think about a mental health
[828.0s - 835.2s]: condition like depression let's take
[830.1s - 839.2s]: depression um uh to start off I can just
[835.2s - 841.6s]: broadly create two you know Columns of
[839.2s - 844.7s]: of things or approaches that one might
[841.6s - 847.8s]: take uh one is this U mental model of
[844.7s - 849.5s]: sort of a molecule deficiency like I'm
[847.8s - 852.4s]: not saying this but there are many who
[849.5s - 855.2s]: at one point thought uh depression is
[852.4s - 857.4s]: related to a deficiency in serotonin or
[855.2s - 859.8s]: depression is related to a deficiency in
[857.4s - 862.4s]: dopamine either levels
[859.8s - 864.6s]: regulation enzymatic control whatever
[862.4s - 866.7s]: the the the level of
[864.6s - 868.7s]: control just this idea that these
[866.7s - 871.0s]: molecules are somehow lacking if you put
[868.7s - 872.9s]: them back you can relieve some symptoms
[871.0s - 875.3s]: of
[872.9s - 877.4s]: depression the other column that comes
[875.3s - 880.1s]: to mind for
[877.4s - 883.4s]: me having looked at the data on
[880.1s - 885.9s]: cognitive behavioral therapy on the data
[883.4s - 887.5s]: on uh psychedelics in the clinical
[885.9s - 890.2s]: setting for the treatment of depression
[887.5s - 892.0s]: ssris and other um so-called
[890.2s - 893.5s]: anti-depressants is this notion of
[892.0s - 894.9s]: neuroplasticity the idea that neural
[893.5s - 897.2s]: circuits can change and that neural
[894.9s - 898.8s]: circuits control our sense of well-being
[897.2s - 901.7s]: our perception of self perception of
[898.8s - 904.4s]: others feelings of agency Etc and it's
[901.7s - 907.2s]: now very clear that if you change levels
[904.4s - 910.7s]: of neuromodulators like dopamine like
[907.2s - 914.4s]: serotonin you don't necessarily cure
[910.7s - 916.6s]: depression but you open a window for
[914.4s - 917.9s]: plasticity and then perhaps the therapy
[916.6s - 920.5s]: that you're doing can modify brain
[917.9s - 922.9s]: circuits more robustly so I think in
[920.5s - 925.0s]: terms of molecule deficiency maybe it's
[922.9s - 927.0s]: a vitamin deficiency a neuromodulator
[925.0s - 928.7s]: deficiency and then I also think about
[927.0s - 931.9s]: plasticity that these treatments are
[928.7s - 934.3s]: just allowing for more brain change more
[931.9s - 938.4s]: rapidly what other columns would you add
[934.3s - 941.4s]: to that picture um and perhaps first do
[938.4s - 943.7s]: you think that picture is um woefully
[941.4s - 944.8s]: inadequate or just partially inadequate
[943.7s - 946.4s]: because I think this is the way most
[944.8s - 947.5s]: people think about the treatment of
[946.4s - 949.4s]: mental health they think oh there's
[947.5s - 951.7s]: something missing you take a drug and
[949.4s - 954.1s]: you get that thing back and then like
[951.7s - 955.4s]: ADHD you don't have enough dopamine or
[954.1s - 957.2s]: what you put it in and then all of a
[955.4s - 959.9s]: sudden attentional circuits work better
[957.2s - 961.4s]: this kind of thing versus plastic
[959.9s - 963.5s]: which is the modification of those
[961.4s - 966.5s]: circuits and the two things are not
[963.5s - 968.7s]: mutually exclusive but I I think until
[966.5s - 969.9s]: now they really hasn't been a a clear
[968.7s - 973.5s]: understanding that there are other
[969.9s - 976.0s]: columns for um for mechanistic change in
[973.5s - 981.2s]: in mental health I would
[976.0s - 983.8s]: say the concept of metabolism metabolic
[981.2s - 985.4s]: regulation mitochondrial function
[983.8s - 987.2s]: mitochondrial
[985.4s - 990.8s]: Health
[987.2s - 993.0s]: actually is an umbrella concept for
[990.8s - 996.2s]: everything you've just said it's an
[993.0s - 998.2s]: umbrella concept for well how do we
[996.2s - 1000.0s]: create neurotransmitters where do these
[998.2s - 1004.8s]: neurotransmitters come from what
[1000.0s - 1007.6s]: regulates their production release from
[1004.8s - 1010.0s]: cells and then even to go further what
[1007.6s - 1014.0s]: impact do those neurotransmitters have
[1010.0s - 1016.6s]: on other cells they are largely
[1014.0s - 1019.2s]: regulating brain
[1016.6s - 1021.9s]: metabolism and the way we usually think
[1019.2s - 1024.2s]: about it is they are regulating brain
[1021.9s - 1026.4s]: activity but if you ask the question
[1024.2s - 1030.3s]: well what is brain activity brain
[1026.4s - 1034.2s]: activity is either is fueled by
[1030.3s - 1037.9s]: metabolism that a a neuron cannot be
[1034.2s - 1039.5s]: active unless it has the capacity to
[1037.9s - 1044.3s]: increase its
[1039.5s - 1046.9s]: ATP kind of production and then when you
[1044.3s - 1049.8s]: suppress a neuron when you when you
[1046.9s - 1051.8s]: inhibit its function the TP production
[1049.8s - 1053.9s]: goes down so whether you want to think
[1051.8s - 1056.5s]: of metabolism as just a consequence of
[1053.9s - 1058.9s]: neural activity I actually think about
[1056.5s - 1060.9s]: it as an integral part of neural
[1058.9s - 1063.6s]: activity it's kind of like your car
[1060.9s - 1066.6s]: can't go without the
[1063.6s - 1068.9s]: engine a cell can't go without
[1066.6s - 1071.2s]: mitochondria um a cell can't do what
[1068.9s - 1072.7s]: it's supposed to do without mitochondria
[1071.2s - 1076.0s]: the other concept that you mentioned
[1072.7s - 1080.3s]: neuroplasticity neuroplasticity is all
[1076.0s - 1083.0s]: about energy and met metabolic resources
[1080.3s - 1086.0s]: to create new
[1083.0s - 1088.2s]: connections new neural connections
[1086.0s - 1092.1s]: between axons
[1088.2s - 1094.9s]: dendrites Somas other other aspects of
[1092.1s - 1097.5s]: neurons and cells and other types of
[1094.9s - 1101.0s]: cells asites
[1097.5s - 1104.2s]: oligodendrocytes um but in order to get
[1101.0s - 1108.0s]: neuroplasticity neuroplasticity implies
[1104.2s - 1109.3s]: growth and modulation and even pruning
[1108.0s - 1112.0s]: but it involves
[1109.3s - 1114.8s]: change and in order for an living
[1112.0s - 1119.3s]: organism to change that
[1114.8s - 1121.5s]: requires this foundational concept of
[1119.3s - 1123.5s]: metabolism now on the surface to a lot
[1121.5s - 1125.1s]: of people that sounds too abstract and
[1123.5s - 1126.5s]: it sounds like well that's ridiculous
[1125.1s - 1128.3s]: then if you're you're saying that
[1126.5s - 1131.0s]: metabolism is everything in biology and
[1128.3s - 1132.6s]: I kind of am of course it is you you
[1131.0s - 1133.6s]: can't talk about biology without talking
[1132.6s - 1135.6s]: about
[1133.6s - 1137.1s]: metabolism but when you talk about
[1135.6s - 1141.3s]: metabolic
[1137.1s - 1143.8s]: Health it becomes much more concrete
[1141.3s - 1147.2s]: pragmatic and
[1143.8s - 1148.5s]: real with real tools that you talk about
[1147.2s - 1151.2s]: all of the
[1148.5s - 1153.0s]: time on this
[1151.2s - 1156.4s]: podcast
[1153.0s - 1160.6s]: exercise promotes metabolic
[1156.4s - 1163.5s]: Health exercise promotes
[1160.6s - 1166.4s]: neuroplasticity they are inseparable you
[1163.5s - 1169.7s]: can't improve your metabolic Health
[1166.4s - 1172.4s]: without also at least opening up the
[1169.7s - 1174.9s]: opportunity for
[1172.4s - 1179.4s]: neuroplasticity improving your diet does
[1174.9s - 1183.2s]: the same thing sleep or lack thereof can
[1179.4s - 1186.8s]: impact this substance use can impact
[1183.2s - 1189.5s]: this and so you know in a way it it
[1186.8s - 1193.1s]: basically says let's connect all of the
[1189.5s - 1195.8s]: dots let's not hyperfocus on serotonin
[1193.1s - 1198.3s]: and a serotonin imbalance or deficiency
[1195.8s - 1199.2s]: as the singular cause of depression
[1198.3s - 1202.4s]: because
[1199.2s - 1204.3s]: for those of you who don't know that is
[1202.4s - 1207.5s]: ridiculously
[1204.3s - 1210.2s]: reductionistic and it is absolutely not
[1207.5s - 1211.3s]: true we know that we know that with
[1210.2s - 1214.4s]: certainty
[1211.3s - 1217.4s]: now you know the the whole serotonin
[1214.4s - 1221.1s]: hypothesis of
[1217.4s - 1223.7s]: depression came about not because
[1221.1s - 1226.5s]: researchers identified serotonin
[1223.7s - 1230.6s]: deficits in the brain that
[1226.5s - 1232.2s]: entire concept came from the observation
[1230.6s - 1235.6s]: that
[1232.2s - 1238.3s]: medications that modulate serotonin
[1235.6s - 1240.6s]: activity or inhibit its
[1238.3s - 1244.8s]: reuptake into
[1240.6s - 1246.6s]: neurons those medications ssris other
[1244.8s - 1249.6s]: types of anti-depressants those
[1246.6s - 1253.9s]: medications can reduce the symptoms of
[1249.6s - 1255.7s]: depression in some people that was just
[1253.9s - 1260.0s]: a
[1255.7s - 1261.1s]: purely serendipitous finding
[1260.0s - 1263.8s]: it was
[1261.1s - 1266.2s]: Serendipity the first anti-depressant
[1263.8s - 1268.7s]: was actually a tuberculosis
[1266.2s - 1272.2s]: treatment they were giving it to
[1268.7s - 1276.4s]: patients on a tuberculosis Ward and an
[1272.2s - 1279.0s]: astute infectious disease doctor noticed
[1276.4s - 1281.4s]: some of these patients are really
[1279.0s - 1282.9s]: depressed but when I give them this
[1281.4s - 1286.2s]: tuberculosis
[1282.9s - 1288.0s]: treatment they perk up like within a few
[1286.2s - 1289.3s]: weeks they start looking a lot less
[1288.0s - 1291.3s]: depressed
[1289.3s - 1293.3s]: and I don't think it's a coincidence I
[1291.3s - 1295.4s]: think it's the medication I'm giving
[1293.3s - 1299.3s]: them do you recall what the drug was
[1295.4s - 1301.5s]: aoide it's the first MAO inhibitor and
[1299.3s - 1306.8s]: um I could be saying the name wrong but
[1301.5s - 1308.7s]: uh it's first MAO inhibitor and uh that
[1306.8s - 1311.6s]: became the first
[1308.7s - 1313.7s]: anti-depressant which makes sense uh MAO
[1311.6s - 1316.5s]: inhibitors inhib of the enzymes that
[1313.7s - 1318.2s]: break down or let's just speak about
[1316.5s - 1320.4s]: these enzymes broadly either I think
[1318.2s - 1323.9s]: most anti-depressant drugs or treatments
[1320.4s - 1326.6s]: for ADHD typical prescription treatments
[1323.9s - 1329.0s]: uh either reduce the breakdown of
[1326.6s - 1330.6s]: neuromodulators like serotonin dopamine
[1329.0s - 1334.0s]: acetylcholine depending on which one
[1330.6s - 1336.6s]: we're talking about or they um they
[1334.0s - 1339.4s]: reduce the reuptake so that there's just
[1336.6s - 1342.2s]: more neurom modulator around for longer
[1339.4s - 1345.3s]: yes tell us about mitochondria in the
[1342.2s - 1346.9s]: framework of mental health so most
[1345.3s - 1348.8s]: people know mitochondria as the
[1346.9s - 1352.8s]: PowerHouse of the cell if if if they
[1348.8s - 1356.5s]: know that it at all so these tiny little
[1352.8s - 1359.2s]: organel and the PowerHouse of the cell
[1356.5s - 1360.8s]: reference means that mitochondria take
[1359.2s - 1364.0s]: the breakdown products of the food that
[1360.8s - 1367.5s]: we're eating they are the primary thing
[1364.0s - 1369.4s]: using the oxygen that we're breathing in
[1367.5s - 1371.8s]: they are creating the carbon dioxide
[1369.4s - 1375.4s]: that we're breathing out and that they
[1371.8s - 1377.6s]: are turning food into ATP which is the
[1375.4s - 1380.7s]: energy currency of the cell so they're
[1377.6s - 1383.0s]: taking food and oxygen and lots of other
[1380.7s - 1387.4s]: things but let's just simplify food and
[1383.0s - 1390.0s]: oxygen converting it into ATP and that
[1387.4s - 1393.5s]: is what the PowerHouse of the cell kind
[1390.0s - 1396.0s]: of refers to there is no doubt they do
[1393.5s - 1398.8s]: that there is no doubt that when that
[1396.0s - 1402.0s]: process stops humans have about six
[1398.8s - 1406.5s]: minutes or so and then we're
[1402.0s - 1408.9s]: dead that process is critical to life
[1406.5s - 1410.2s]: there is no other process in the body
[1408.9s - 1413.6s]: that you can
[1410.2s - 1417.6s]: disrupt that will kill the organism
[1413.6s - 1421.3s]: faster it is Central to living organisms
[1417.6s - 1424.6s]: this production of ATP so I don't at all
[1421.3s - 1427.4s]: mean to take away or minimize that
[1424.6s - 1430.6s]: function but research over the last 25
[1427.4s - 1432.5s]: years has completely upended that
[1430.6s - 1434.3s]: simplistic notion of what mitochondria
[1432.5s - 1437.2s]: are doing they are actually doing so
[1434.3s - 1439.8s]: much more some people have created the
[1437.2s - 1441.0s]: reference that MIT are like the workers
[1439.8s - 1444.3s]: inside a
[1441.0s - 1446.8s]: cell that in order for a cell to work
[1444.3s - 1449.3s]: you need a Workforce because there's so
[1446.8s - 1453.0s]: much that needs to be done signals need
[1449.3s - 1455.8s]: to be sent thing like all this work all
[1453.0s - 1458.4s]: of these different things need to be
[1455.8s - 1460.4s]: functioning and mitochondria are
[1458.4s - 1462.5s]: absolutely providing the energy for
[1460.4s - 1466.2s]: those things to happen but they're also
[1462.5s - 1469.5s]: orchestrating a lot of it so for example
[1466.2s - 1471.7s]: they play a direct role in in converting
[1469.5s - 1473.9s]: food into some of the substrates for the
[1471.7s - 1477.2s]: production of
[1473.9s - 1480.0s]: neurotransmitters um but they also go
[1477.2s - 1482.2s]: further they store like some
[1480.0s - 1484.7s]: neurotransmitters like Gaba within
[1482.2s - 1489.5s]: themselves and that plays a role in
[1484.7s - 1493.0s]: gaba's release from a neuron they
[1489.5s - 1495.1s]: actually go to the cell membrane and
[1493.0s - 1499.2s]: move along the
[1495.1s - 1501.3s]: membrane dispensing vesicles of neuro
[1499.2s - 1505.5s]: transmitters and when you take the
[1501.3s - 1509.3s]: mitochondria away from the
[1505.5s - 1512.6s]: synapse but provide that synapse with
[1509.3s - 1514.0s]: ATP vesicles don't get released
[1512.6s - 1516.8s]: neurotransmitters aren't getting
[1514.0s - 1519.0s]: released the mitochondria are doing more
[1516.8s - 1522.4s]: we don't exactly know what but they're
[1519.0s - 1526.5s]: doing more than just providing the
[1522.4s - 1530.0s]: energy they they play a role in turning
[1526.5s - 1534.6s]: inflammation and immune cell both on and
[1530.0s - 1538.6s]: off they help start the process but they
[1534.6s - 1539.6s]: also help coordinate the cessation of
[1538.6s - 1541.3s]: that
[1539.6s - 1545.2s]: process
[1541.3s - 1547.4s]: they play an instrumental role in both
[1545.2s - 1549.2s]: the first and the last step in the
[1547.4s - 1552.0s]: synthesis of
[1549.2s - 1553.6s]: cortisol and they play a role in the
[1552.0s - 1555.7s]: first step in the synthesis of all of
[1553.6s - 1558.8s]: the steroid hormones which include
[1555.7s - 1560.5s]: estrogen testosterone progesterone
[1558.8s - 1563.6s]: so that if you have
[1560.5s - 1566.1s]: disregulation of cortisol or if you have
[1563.6s - 1567.9s]: disregulation of testosterone or
[1566.1s - 1570.0s]: estrogen or
[1567.9s - 1573.2s]: progesterone you
[1570.0s - 1575.8s]: must understand the role of mitochondria
[1573.2s - 1579.5s]: in that disregulation because they are
[1575.8s - 1581.1s]: critical in the production and release
[1579.5s - 1584.8s]: of these
[1581.1s - 1586.0s]: hormones they are the primary regulator
[1584.8s - 1588.6s]: of
[1586.0s - 1590.3s]: epigenetics so epigenetics are the
[1588.6s - 1592.9s]: expression of genes from the cell
[1590.3s - 1594.6s]: nucleus and researchers have long known
[1592.9s - 1598.1s]: that that's related to levels of
[1594.6s - 1600.7s]: reactive oxygen species it's related to
[1598.1s - 1601.8s]: levels of calcium it's related to other
[1600.7s - 1604.7s]: cell
[1601.8s - 1607.4s]: signals those cell signals are mostly
[1604.7s - 1610.2s]: originating within mitochondria during
[1607.4s - 1612.4s]: the development of any cell
[1610.2s - 1614.3s]: mitochondria they are like a universe
[1612.4s - 1616.7s]: unto themselves and there's so much we
[1614.3s - 1619.3s]: don't know about them but what what
[1616.7s - 1623.4s]: researchers have found is that mondria
[1619.3s - 1625.4s]: actually line up literally line up in an
[1623.4s - 1628.2s]: organized fashion around the cell
[1625.4s - 1630.5s]: nucleus and take on different
[1628.2s - 1632.4s]: confirmations and that is somehow
[1630.5s - 1634.5s]: sending
[1632.4s - 1637.8s]: signals to the
[1634.5s - 1640.0s]: Gen to result in the expression or the
[1637.8s - 1643.1s]: suppression of different
[1640.0s - 1645.3s]: genes from the nucleus and that when
[1643.1s - 1647.9s]: researchers take these mitochondria and
[1645.3s - 1650.9s]: like mess them up or something the cell
[1647.9s - 1653.4s]: does develop normally you know they've
[1650.9s - 1655.6s]: been implicated in all of the phases of
[1653.4s - 1659.7s]: the human stress response to
[1655.6s - 1663.2s]: psychological stress so that includes
[1659.7s - 1666.6s]: cortisol release noradrenaline release
[1663.2s - 1669.5s]: it includes inflammation and it includes
[1666.6s - 1671.7s]: epigenetic changes so those are kind of
[1669.5s - 1673.7s]: the four buckets of the human stress
[1671.7s - 1675.6s]: response
[1673.7s - 1679.2s]: cortisol
[1675.6s - 1682.8s]: adrenaline inflammation and epigenetic
[1679.2s - 1686.4s]: changes and researchers actually
[1682.8s - 1688.7s]: manipulated mitochondrial genes two
[1686.4s - 1691.0s]: genes in the cell nucleus that control
[1688.7s - 1693.4s]: for mitochondrial proteins and two genes
[1691.0s - 1696.4s]: in mitochondria themselves and by
[1693.4s - 1698.2s]: manipulating these four different genes
[1696.4s - 1702.4s]: one at a time in
[1698.2s - 1706.5s]: mice they could impact all of the four
[1702.4s - 1708.5s]: aspects of the stress response and so
[1706.5s - 1712.6s]: what that means is that mitochondria are
[1708.5s - 1714.2s]: somehow involved in regulating the human
[1712.6s - 1717.1s]: stress
[1714.2s - 1718.8s]: response and so the way that I think
[1717.1s - 1721.5s]: about it is
[1718.8s - 1723.4s]: that and the way that many researchers
[1721.5s - 1725.7s]: actually think about it
[1723.4s - 1728.5s]: now is that
[1725.7s - 1731.8s]: mitochondria you know there are hundreds
[1728.5s - 1735.0s]: sometimes thousands of them in our cells
[1731.8s - 1736.8s]: in each of our cells most neurons have
[1735.0s - 1738.8s]: thousands of
[1736.8s - 1741.2s]: mitochondria the mitochondria are
[1738.8s - 1743.9s]: actually moving around they use the
[1741.2s - 1746.5s]: cytoskeleton to move around the cell
[1743.9s - 1749.5s]: they fuse with each other
[1746.5s - 1752.2s]: they it's called mitochondrial Dynamics
[1749.5s - 1755.5s]: they like change shape they do all sorts
[1752.2s - 1757.1s]: of things and again that impacts all of
[1755.5s - 1759.2s]: these signaling
[1757.1s - 1761.3s]: processes but that's just within one
[1759.2s - 1765.0s]: little cell so you can think of one cell
[1761.3s - 1767.6s]: is like almost a village of
[1765.0s - 1769.3s]: mitochondria that they're all just doing
[1767.6s - 1772.0s]: different things things and working
[1769.3s - 1774.7s]: together to help that cell function but
[1772.0s - 1775.9s]: in fact when you think about hormones
[1774.7s - 1778.5s]: like
[1775.9s - 1780.8s]: cortisol you can think about it as a way
[1778.5s - 1782.6s]: for mitochondria in one cell to produce
[1780.8s - 1785.4s]: cortisol that they can get sent to
[1782.6s - 1789.0s]: mitochondria in another cell to to make
[1785.4s - 1791.7s]: that other cell do something to either
[1789.0s - 1794.1s]: increase its activity or decrease its
[1791.7s - 1797.5s]: activity some people actually think
[1794.1s - 1799.4s]: about human cells as just a network of
[1797.5s - 1801.9s]: mitoch
[1799.4s - 1806.3s]: all kind of the mitochondria throughout
[1801.9s - 1809.5s]: the body and brain are just doing all
[1806.3s - 1812.2s]: sorts of things and at the end of the
[1809.5s - 1813.7s]: day we come back to just common sense at
[1812.2s - 1816.3s]: the end of the day it's about helping
[1813.7s - 1819.6s]: the organism adapt and
[1816.3s - 1823.3s]: survive ultimately
[1819.6s - 1825.8s]: organisms rule number one they need to
[1823.3s - 1828.2s]: survive rule number two they need to
[1825.8s - 1829.4s]: reproduce and rule number three they
[1828.2s - 1832.9s]: need to
[1829.4s - 1836.9s]: adapt and mitochondria are playing a
[1832.9s - 1840.1s]: foundational role in all of those basic
[1836.9s - 1842.9s]: aspects of organismal
[1840.1s - 1844.7s]: survival and again to some people that
[1842.9s - 1846.2s]: well that's so high level that's like
[1844.7s - 1849.1s]: well you're saying it's everything I'm
[1846.2s - 1851.3s]: like yeah it kind of is and mental
[1849.1s - 1853.1s]: health falls under it how could we think
[1851.3s - 1855.4s]: about mental health without thinking
[1853.1s - 1858.7s]: about the big picture like let's start
[1855.4s - 1862.5s]: with the big picture and then let's put
[1858.7s - 1865.3s]: Health into it and let's put the lack of
[1862.5s - 1869.7s]: adaptation or the lack of survival or
[1865.3s - 1871.8s]: the um these other things I'd like to
[1869.7s - 1875.0s]: take a quick break and thank our sponsor
[1871.8s - 1877.4s]: ag1 ag1 is an all-in-one vitamin mineral
[1875.0s - 1880.5s]: probiotic drink with adaptogens I've
[1877.4s - 1881.8s]: been taking ag1 daily since 2012 so I'm
[1880.5s - 1884.4s]: delighted that they're sponsoring this
[1881.8s - 1886.3s]: podcast the reason I started taking ag1
[1884.4s - 1887.7s]: and the reason I still take ag1 is
[1886.3s - 1889.0s]: because it is the highest quality and
[1887.7s - 1891.2s]: most post complete foundational
[1889.0s - 1893.1s]: nutritional supplement what that means
[1891.2s - 1895.4s]: is that ag1 ensures that you're getting
[1893.1s - 1897.4s]: all the necessary vitamins minerals and
[1895.4s - 1899.8s]: other micronutrients to form a strong
[1897.4s - 1902.1s]: foundation for your daily Health ag1
[1899.8s - 1904.0s]: also has probiotics and prebiotics that
[1902.1s - 1905.9s]: support a healthy gut microbiome your
[1904.0s - 1908.1s]: gut microbiome consists of trillions of
[1905.9s - 1910.0s]: microorganisms that line your digestive
[1908.1s - 1911.7s]: tract and impact things such as your
[1910.0s - 1914.1s]: immune system status your metabolic
[1911.7s - 1915.6s]: Health your hormone health and much more
[1914.1s - 1918.7s]: so I've consistently found that when I
[1915.6s - 1920.5s]: take ag1 daily my digestion is improved
[1918.7s - 1922.9s]: my immune system is more robust and my
[1920.5s - 1924.4s]: mood and mental focus are at their best
[1922.9s - 1927.3s]: in fact if I could take Just One
[1924.4s - 1929.3s]: supplement that supplement would be ag1
[1927.3s - 1932.8s]: if you'd like to try ag1 you can go to
[1929.3s - 1934.6s]: drink a1.com huberman to claim a special
[1932.8s - 1937.0s]: offer they'll give you five free travel
[1934.6s - 1940.2s]: packs plus a year supply of vitamin D3
[1937.0s - 1943.4s]: K2 with your order of ag1 again go to
[1940.2s - 1945.5s]: drink a1.com huberman to claim this
[1943.4s - 1947.9s]: special offer today's episode is also
[1945.5s - 1949.6s]: brought To Us by eight sleep eight sleep
[1947.9s - 1952.1s]: Mak smart mattress covers with cooling
[1949.6s - 1953.7s]: Heating and sleep tracking capacity now
[1952.1s - 1955.3s]: I've spoken before on this podcast about
[1953.7s - 1957.4s]: the critical need for us to get adequate
[1955.3s - 1959.2s]: amounts of quality sleep each and every
[1957.4s - 1961.1s]: night now one of the best ways to ensure
[1959.2s - 1962.4s]: a great night's sleep is to ensure that
[1961.1s - 1964.2s]: the temperature of your sleeping
[1962.4s - 1966.1s]: environment is correct and that's
[1964.2s - 1968.0s]: because in order to fall and stay deeply
[1966.1s - 1970.5s]: asleep your body temperature actually
[1968.0s - 1971.8s]: has to drop about 1 to 3° and in order
[1970.5s - 1973.9s]: to wake up feeling refreshed and
[1971.8s - 1976.8s]: energized your body temperature actually
[1973.9s - 1978.3s]: has to increase by about 1 to 3° eight
[1976.8s - 1979.9s]: sleep automatically regul regulates the
[1978.3s - 1982.1s]: temperature of your bed throughout the
[1979.9s - 1984.0s]: night according to your unique needs now
[1982.1s - 1985.5s]: I find that extremely useful because I
[1984.0s - 1987.6s]: like to make the bed really cool at the
[1985.5s - 1989.8s]: beginning of the night even colder in
[1987.6s - 1991.4s]: the middle of the night and warm as I
[1989.8s - 1993.3s]: wake up that's what gives me the most
[1991.4s - 1994.6s]: slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement
[1993.3s - 1996.3s]: sleep and I know that because eight
[1994.6s - 1998.0s]: sleep has a great sleep tracker that
[1996.3s - 1999.2s]: tells me how well I've slept and the
[1998.0s - 2000.8s]: types of sleep that I'm getting
[1999.2s - 2002.6s]: throughout the night I've been sleeping
[2000.8s - 2004.4s]: on an eights Sleep mattress cover for 4
[2002.6s - 2006.2s]: years now and it has completely
[2004.4s - 2008.6s]: transformed and improved the quality of
[2006.2s - 2010.8s]: my sleep their latest model the Pod 4
[2008.6s - 2012.3s]: ultra also has snoring detection that
[2010.8s - 2014.2s]: will automatically lift your head a few
[2012.3s - 2016.1s]: degrees in order to improve your air
[2014.2s - 2017.7s]: flow and stop you from snoring if you
[2016.1s - 2019.5s]: decide to try eight sleep you have 30
[2017.7s - 2020.9s]: days to try it at home and you can
[2019.5s - 2022.7s]: return it if you don't like it no
[2020.9s - 2025.5s]: questions asked but I'm sure that you'll

[2038.2s - 2044.6s]: 4 ultra what are some of the things that
[2041.2s - 2048.6s]: we know can improve mitochondrial health
[2044.6s - 2050.3s]: either number function or otherwise and
[2048.6s - 2051.9s]: maybe we can talk about the basics first
[2050.3s - 2053.6s]: and get a little bit granular if you
[2051.9s - 2055.0s]: could about you know what are the
[2053.6s - 2056.9s]: prescriptions for keeping your
[2055.0s - 2058.4s]: mitochondrial healthy or improving your
[2056.9s - 2060.9s]: mitochondrial number and improving their
[2058.4s - 2065.3s]: function and then uh we can transition
[2060.9s - 2068.0s]: from there to the more let's just say um
[2065.3s - 2070.1s]: uh the more advanced ways of doing doing
[2068.0s - 2072.0s]: that um is there a role for
[2070.1s - 2074.1s]: supplementation is there a role for
[2072.0s - 2076.6s]: drugs is there uh you know these days
[2074.1s - 2078.1s]: well I hear about urethan a I um because
[2076.6s - 2080.3s]: I'm a little bit of an adventure these
[2078.1s - 2082.2s]: days I um and I'm turning 50 later this
[2080.3s - 2084.8s]: year I decide to experiment with a
[2082.2s - 2086.5s]: peptide that is uh sr31 which is
[2084.8s - 2088.9s]: specifically to improve mitochondrial
[2086.5s - 2090.0s]: function I'm doing this with the full
[2088.9s - 2092.3s]: understanding it may do nothing or it
[2090.0s - 2095.2s]: may kill me I don't know but we'll find
[2092.3s - 2098.7s]: out but um someone had to do it and and
[2095.2s - 2101.8s]: I'm a one variable at a time kind of guy
[2098.7s - 2103.6s]: um so it was important for me to stay
[2101.8s - 2105.8s]: with my current regimen and only change
[2103.6s - 2108.5s]: that do blood work etc because a lot of
[2105.8s - 2110.3s]: people some people out there are more um
[2108.5s - 2112.0s]: in the mode of trying to do a bunch of
[2110.3s - 2114.4s]: things and and I don't think that's as
[2112.0s - 2116.4s]: helpful to me it's also just not not
[2114.4s - 2118.3s]: it's not in keeping with my S scientist
[2116.4s - 2120.6s]: one scientist that is great that's right
[2118.3s - 2124.4s]: I'm monogamous with respect to variables
[2120.6s - 2126.4s]: right so what can we do at a basic level
[2124.4s - 2128.7s]: to keep and improve our mitochondrial
[2126.4s - 2131.3s]: number and function and if we have to
[2128.7s - 2133.8s]: hit on some of the usual suspects fine
[2131.3s - 2135.9s]: but if you could tell us how how we can
[2133.8s - 2137.6s]: do this so I'm really going to start
[2135.9s - 2139.6s]: with the basics and they're going to
[2137.6s - 2142.9s]: sound cliche and they're going to sound
[2139.6s - 2146.1s]: too basic to most people and I just want
[2142.9s - 2148.0s]: to set the stage for even for severe
[2146.1s - 2150.0s]: mental illness we can talk about
[2148.0s - 2152.0s]: strategies that will work and these
[2150.0s - 2154.2s]: strategies that I'm going to describe
[2152.0s - 2157.0s]: are not really appropriate like when
[2154.2s - 2159.3s]: when somebody becomes severely ill these
[2157.0s - 2162.3s]: strategies May may not be sufficient but
[2159.3s - 2164.8s]: the basics are what we call the field of
[2162.3s - 2167.8s]: Lifestyle medicine so there are six
[2164.8s - 2169.6s]: pillars of Lifestyle medicine they
[2167.8s - 2172.7s]: include diet
[2169.6s - 2174.9s]: nutrition exercise or
[2172.7s - 2179.1s]: movement
[2174.9s - 2180.6s]: sleep managing substance use ideally
[2179.1s - 2182.2s]: reducing it or minimizing it or
[2180.6s - 2185.7s]: eliminating
[2182.2s - 2189.4s]: it stress reduction
[2185.7s - 2192.4s]: practices mindfulness meditation yoga
[2189.4s - 2195.5s]: and the last one is
[2192.4s - 2198.5s]: relationships I throw in the word
[2195.5s - 2200.1s]: purpose into relationships because I
[2198.5s - 2202.6s]: think even if you don't have a lot of
[2200.1s - 2206.0s]: friends or family you can still have a
[2202.6s - 2209.3s]: very full thriving life if you have a
[2206.0s - 2212.3s]: purpose so those are the six pillars
[2209.3s - 2215.0s]: unfortunately this is where the cliches
[2212.3s - 2218.1s]: and the worthless advice begin
[2215.0s - 2219.9s]: especially in the diet nutrition camp
[2218.1s - 2222.2s]: because people will say eat more plants
[2219.9s - 2223.7s]: eat some broccoli have some good
[2222.2s - 2225.8s]: blueberries blueberries have
[2223.7s - 2228.3s]: antioxidants have some
[2225.8s - 2231.6s]: blueberries on whatever else you're
[2228.3s - 2233.2s]: eating and everything will be fine if
[2231.6s - 2236.4s]: you just add a couple of servings of
[2233.2s - 2239.4s]: blueberries a week you'll improve your
[2236.4s - 2242.6s]: health brain food and that it is such
[2239.4s - 2246.5s]: worthless advice it is not at all that
[2242.6s - 2250.0s]: simple and so so I think diet
[2246.5s - 2252.4s]: nutrition gets complicated fast the
[2250.0s - 2254.2s]: other things are actually pretty
[2252.4s - 2259.3s]: straightforward should you move your
[2254.2s - 2261.3s]: body yes should you stress your
[2259.3s - 2264.4s]: body
[2261.3s - 2266.6s]: intermittently allowing for full
[2264.4s - 2269.2s]: recovery yes that's what most people
[2266.6s - 2272.2s]: call exercise and what are you doing
[2269.2s - 2274.8s]: when you exercise you're actually if we
[2272.2s - 2278.1s]: look at like the muscles for example
[2274.8s - 2281.6s]: muscle tissue what exactly does exercise
[2278.1s - 2283.8s]: do whether it's isometric exercise to
[2281.6s - 2286.3s]: increase the size of the muscle or
[2283.8s - 2288.0s]: whether it's endurance capacity which
[2286.3s - 2291.8s]: actually does not change the size of the
[2288.0s - 2296.9s]: muscle at all um but allows for somebody
[2291.8s - 2299.5s]: to run longer faster harder so marathon
[2296.9s - 2300.8s]: runners for example can be quite thin
[2299.5s - 2302.4s]: you can look at a marathon runner and
[2300.8s - 2304.5s]: think you're not even an
[2302.4s - 2307.7s]: athlete they don't look all that
[2304.5s - 2309.1s]: different yet they can run
[2307.7s - 2311.7s]: sometimes 100
[2309.1s - 2313.9s]: miles and what makes their muscles
[2311.7s - 2316.7s]: different than my muscles cuz I can't
[2313.9s - 2319.4s]: run 100 miles me either what makes their
[2316.7s - 2321.4s]: muscles different than mine even if the
[2319.4s - 2322.8s]: size isn't different there is one and
[2321.4s - 2324.5s]: only one thing that makes their muscles
[2322.8s - 2326.6s]: different and it's called mitochondria
[2324.5s - 2328.6s]: the number the number of mitochondria
[2326.6s - 2330.5s]: and and almost certainly the health of
[2328.6s - 2332.8s]: mitochondria you can actually take a
[2330.5s - 2334.9s]: biopsy of their muscle and you will see
[2332.8s - 2336.7s]: a much higher density of mitochondria in
[2334.9s - 2341.0s]: their muscle tissue than you will in
[2336.7s - 2343.7s]: mine if you actually then did a a a more
[2341.0s - 2346.5s]: thorough assessment of ATP
[2343.7s - 2348.2s]: capacity they their muscles or their
[2346.5s - 2350.5s]: mitochondria would be much healthier
[2348.2s - 2353.6s]: than mine they their mitochondria would
[2350.5s - 2355.5s]: have greater capacity for ATP production
[2353.6s - 2358.3s]: than my mitochondria
[2355.5s - 2360.7s]: would um so that's exercise there are
[2358.3s - 2362.6s]: lots of things you can do with exercise
[2360.7s - 2364.9s]: for people who don't exercise at all yes
[2362.6s - 2366.8s]: get out and just walk just do something
[2364.9s - 2368.7s]: maybe get some sunlight in morning while
[2366.8s - 2369.8s]: you're while you're at it um that sounds
[2368.7s - 2371.8s]: like a good
[2369.8s - 2376.0s]: idea
[2371.8s - 2377.5s]: uh the substance use um it's obvious
[2376.0s - 2379.4s]: it's the thing you've been talking about
[2377.5s - 2381.1s]: it I've been talking about substances
[2379.4s - 2384.6s]: deplete mitochondria I've been very
[2381.1s - 2389.6s]: interested in this um I'm a big lover of
[2384.6s - 2391.5s]: certain genres of music and um whenever
[2389.6s - 2393.2s]: topic of music comes up the name Rick
[2391.5s - 2395.4s]: Rubin comes up because he's been on this
[2393.2s - 2397.4s]: podcast twice the the famous Rick Rubin
[2395.4s - 2399.7s]: amazing producer and I'm blessed to have
[2397.4s - 2402.2s]: as a close friend and I often ask Rick
[2399.7s - 2406.1s]: I'm like why are so many of these folks
[2402.2s - 2410.6s]: in the in music dead there seems to be a
[2406.1s - 2412.2s]: history of people who did um stimulants
[2410.6s - 2415.5s]: it took a lot of stimulants cocaine and
[2412.2s - 2419.7s]: amphetamine in particular um musicians
[2415.5s - 2421.6s]: that did that in the 70s and 80s and 90s
[2419.7s - 2424.8s]: seemed to drop dead of heart attacks
[2421.6s - 2428.3s]: later when they were not currently using
[2424.8s - 2430.9s]: as far as we know those stimulants is it
[2428.3s - 2433.8s]: is it the case that stimulants like
[2430.9s - 2436.0s]: cocaine and amphetamine deplete cells of
[2433.8s - 2439.4s]: mitochondria do we do we know that to be
[2436.0s - 2443.6s]: true we do know and it's slightly more
[2439.4s - 2448.4s]: complex story so it's all about the
[2443.6s - 2452.9s]: dose um so stimulants are used to treat
[2448.4s - 2455.9s]: ADHD and we know that people we've known
[2452.9s - 2458.8s]: for decades people who have ADHD who
[2455.9s - 2460.8s]: have symptoms of ADHD have glucose hypom
[2458.8s - 2464.3s]: metabolism in their
[2460.8s - 2468.4s]: brains so their brains are not producing
[2464.3s - 2471.9s]: enough ATP from glucose what is one way
[2468.4s - 2474.4s]: to increase that dopamine dopamine will
[2471.9s - 2476.3s]: increase that so you can give people
[2474.4s - 2480.0s]: stimulants
[2476.3s - 2483.4s]: to improve their brain metabolism
[2480.0s - 2485.5s]: enough so that they now no longer have
[2483.4s - 2488.1s]: symptoms or at least have a reduction in
[2485.5s - 2491.6s]: their symptoms that story is
[2488.1s - 2494.9s]: unequivocally true we have lots of
[2491.6s - 2498.3s]: animal data human neuroimaging data
[2494.9s - 2499.7s]: clinical research studies documenting
[2498.3s - 2503.0s]: that
[2499.7s - 2506.5s]: appropriate doses of stimulants so
[2503.0s - 2509.2s]: that's usually loish doses can improve
[2506.5s - 2510.8s]: brain metabolism and what that means is
[2509.2s - 2514.1s]: that it's they're actually stimulating
[2510.8s - 2518.3s]: mitochondria to produce more
[2514.1s - 2521.0s]: ATP however metabolism is all about
[2518.3s - 2524.5s]: balance you can underdo it and you can
[2521.0s - 2527.6s]: overdo it and when you overdo it what
[2524.5s - 2530.6s]: happens is that if you hypers stimulate
[2527.6s - 2533.1s]: mitochondria with high doses of
[2530.6s - 2535.4s]: stimulants the mitochondria are
[2533.1s - 2538.3s]: essentially running on all
[2535.4s - 2541.4s]: cylinders and electrons start leaking
[2538.3s - 2543.6s]: out of the electron transport chain and
[2541.4s - 2546.5s]: what happens is that that creates
[2543.6s - 2549.0s]: reactive oxygen species which then
[2546.5s - 2551.7s]: damage the mitochondria themselves and
[2549.0s - 2555.6s]: damage other aspects of the cell and it
[2551.7s - 2559.1s]: can lead to Chronic mitochondrial
[2555.6s - 2561.6s]: disfunction chronic metabolic
[2559.1s - 2562.9s]: dysfunction it's challenging with
[2561.6s - 2565.7s]: stimulants because people are looking
[2562.9s - 2568.5s]: for a yes or no answer so Dr Palmer do
[2565.7s - 2571.6s]: you think stimulant are good or bad I
[2568.5s - 2573.5s]: don't have an answer to that it depends
[2571.6s - 2576.4s]: on the person it depends on the dose of
[2573.5s - 2579.0s]: stimulants it depends on the type of
[2576.4s - 2582.9s]: stimulant it depends on what impact it's
[2579.0s - 2585.3s]: having on that person um but we need to
[2582.9s - 2587.1s]: open our minds to the possibility that
[2585.3s - 2589.9s]: yes maybe some people do benefit from
[2587.1s - 2593.4s]: stimulants and maybe at the same time
[2589.9s - 2594.8s]: other people are harmed in catastrophic
[2593.4s - 2598.9s]: Ways by
[2594.8s - 2600.9s]: stimulants um and it it can all be
[2598.9s - 2602.2s]: linked through mitochondrial mechanisms
[2600.9s - 2604.4s]: it can certainly be linked through
[2602.2s - 2605.8s]: dopamine but again we have to ask well
[2604.4s - 2609.3s]: what is that dopamine
[2605.8s - 2611.1s]: doing to to the target cells that when
[2609.3s - 2614.6s]: dopamine gets
[2611.1s - 2617.6s]: released and connects with the dopamine
[2614.6s - 2620.5s]: receptor what happens to that Target
[2617.6s - 2623.4s]: cell it changes the metabolism of that
[2620.5s - 2626.3s]: Target cell it increases the activity of
[2623.4s - 2628.9s]: that Target cell so stimulants are one
[2626.3s - 2630.6s]: back to this bigger kind of Lifestyle
[2628.9s - 2633.3s]: medicine picture stimulants are
[2630.6s - 2635.6s]: definitely one hyos stimulants very
[2633.3s - 2638.0s]: harmful to human health what are some
[2635.6s - 2641.4s]: others alcohol
[2638.0s - 2643.2s]: we've known since the 1960s in the 1960s
[2641.4s - 2647.2s]: researchers were trying to figure out
[2643.2s - 2650.3s]: how the hell does alcohol cause
[2647.2s - 2652.5s]: therosis we knew that we've known that
[2650.3s - 2655.5s]: we've known that for a long time
[2652.5s - 2657.9s]: alcoholics develop liver failure they
[2655.5s - 2661.7s]: develop therosis of the liver and they
[2657.9s - 2665.4s]: can die from it how exactly does that
[2661.7s - 2668.0s]: happen in the 1960s researchers figured
[2665.4s - 2670.2s]: out it's mitochondial tox toxicity
[2668.0s - 2672.4s]: interesting in the liver cells that is
[2670.2s - 2676.5s]: what's making the liver cells
[2672.4s - 2679.4s]: die that alcohol gets converted into
[2676.5s - 2682.3s]: this molecule called acid alahh which is
[2679.4s - 2683.8s]: very toxic to lots of cell parts but in
[2682.3s - 2687.4s]: particular to
[2683.8s - 2690.9s]: mitochondria mitochondria are processing
[2687.4s - 2693.9s]: this Alcohol and Other enzymes and kind
[2690.9s - 2697.1s]: of other things are trying to detoxify
[2693.9s - 2700.0s]: the alcohol but at the end of the day
[2697.1s - 2702.2s]: mitochondrial toxicity seems to be a
[2700.0s - 2704.5s]: clear route so when you know when I was
[2702.2s - 2708.3s]: doing research on mitochondria for the
[2704.5s - 2709.1s]: book it I there was an over there were
[2708.3s - 2711.9s]: over
[2709.1s - 2715.3s]: 10,000 published research
[2711.9s - 2718.0s]: articles of alcohol and mitochondria and
[2715.3s - 2721.8s]: I was initially shocked by that and I
[2718.0s - 2723.6s]: wondered like what's that about like how
[2721.8s - 2725.4s]: that's that's how I know this 1960s
[2723.6s - 2728.5s]: story and everything else is because
[2725.4s - 2730.8s]: researchers been looking at how how is
[2728.5s - 2734.3s]: it that alcohol can be so
[2730.8s - 2736.6s]: toxic and the two organs that are most
[2734.3s - 2739.9s]: effective are the liver because that's
[2736.6s - 2742.2s]: the primary organ trying to detoxify it
[2739.9s - 2744.6s]: and then the brain and why the brain
[2742.2s - 2746.2s]: because the brain is highly sensitive to
[2744.6s - 2751.0s]: metabolic
[2746.2s - 2754.6s]: disruption other substances of abuse
[2751.0s - 2757.2s]: tobacco the carcinogens in tobacco so
[2754.6s - 2759.5s]: not nicotine per se do we know if
[2757.2s - 2762.3s]: nicotine is depleting mitochondria
[2759.5s - 2766.4s]: nicotine is a stimulant for mitochondria
[2762.3s - 2769.8s]: so again similar story low doses can be
[2766.4s - 2771.6s]: great high doses May in fact be toxic oh
[2769.8s - 2773.4s]: good you've got to get you gotta you got
[2771.6s - 2776.9s]: to find the right balance not a big
[2773.4s - 2780.2s]: nicotine guy but lately I've started uh
[2776.9s - 2783.6s]: chewing half of a piece of nicotine gum
[2780.2s - 2786.6s]: a few times a week um so 2 milligrams to
[2783.6s - 2789.8s]: four milligrams which is very low dose
[2786.6s - 2792.1s]: um couple couple of I would say maybe
[2789.8s - 2794.9s]: three four days a week I'll do that and
[2792.1s - 2796.2s]: um I'm doing it specifically for brain
[2794.9s - 2798.1s]: health reasons and I have no
[2796.2s - 2799.4s]: relationship to any nicotine pouch or
[2798.1s - 2802.2s]: gum or anything like that so I want to
[2799.4s - 2804.4s]: be really like company um so I'm doing a
[2802.2s - 2806.1s]: little experiment and uh you know it's
[2804.4s - 2808.1s]: it's interesting stimulant because it
[2806.1s - 2809.6s]: relaxes you a little bit too but I
[2808.1s - 2811.5s]: wouldn't want kids to start doing this
[2809.6s - 2813.0s]: or people in their 20s or 30s like I
[2811.5s - 2815.7s]: said I'm approaching the fifth floor I'm
[2813.0s - 2817.0s]: going to be 50 in September and um I
[2815.7s - 2818.4s]: want to do everything I can to hold on
[2817.0s - 2820.8s]: the neurons I've got so I think
[2818.4s - 2823.6s]: low-level stimulation of perhaps the
[2820.8s - 2826.7s]: mitochondria and other um certainly the
[2823.6s - 2828.0s]: stoline system with nicotine it's a good
[2826.7s - 2829.9s]: idea but what I see is a lot of people
[2828.0s - 2831.5s]: who are taking these pouches that range
[2829.9s - 2834.4s]: from anywhere from 3 milligrams On The
[2831.5s - 2837.6s]: Low End uh Dose side all the way up to
[2834.4s - 2839.8s]: eight milligrams and it is very habit
[2837.6s - 2841.0s]: forming people start with one pouch or
[2839.8s - 2842.5s]: two pouches a day and pretty soon
[2841.0s - 2846.6s]: they're doing a canister every day or
[2842.5s - 2848.8s]: two so even the cost starts to be a big
[2846.6s - 2850.2s]: deal but it's it's pretty incredible was
[2848.8s - 2851.1s]: on the Berkeley campus and I went to a
[2850.2s - 2853.0s]: little convenience store near the
[2851.1s - 2855.5s]: Berkeley campus recently this kid came
[2853.0s - 2857.8s]: in and we started chatting a podcast fan
[2855.5s - 2859.7s]: we were chatting and he was there to buy
[2857.8s - 2862.2s]: uh nicotine pouches I said how many of
[2859.7s - 2864.8s]: those do you go through a week he's like
[2862.2s - 2868.6s]: seven or eight I was like really was
[2864.8s - 2870.7s]: engineering student but in my years in
[2868.6s - 2873.0s]: college it was always just you know some
[2870.7s - 2875.6s]: coffee or something yeah some coffee we
[2873.0s - 2877.5s]: didn't really have stick with coffee for
[2875.6s - 2879.1s]: the young for Young Folks yeah
[2877.5s - 2882.2s]: for the young little a little bit of
[2879.1s - 2886.1s]: coffee it's about it's about dose and
[2882.2s - 2889.5s]: it's about look so most
[2886.1s - 2891.5s]: things that enhance
[2889.5s - 2894.2s]: metabolism
[2891.5s - 2896.4s]: quickly can be
[2894.2s - 2898.1s]: addictive and I think that's the
[2896.4s - 2903.7s]: challenge for a lot of
[2898.1s - 2908.4s]: people is that you get that energy right
[2903.7s - 2910.2s]: away at some point you acclimate to that
[2908.4s - 2913.0s]: substance
[2910.2s - 2914.1s]: somewhat and then you want more you want
[2913.0s - 2915.6s]: that
[2914.1s - 2918.0s]: same
[2915.6s - 2919.6s]: increase that you got
[2918.0s - 2922.8s]: before
[2919.6s - 2926.1s]: um so it's just important to kind of be
[2922.8s - 2928.8s]: mindful that you can
[2926.1s - 2930.5s]: overstimulate metabolism mitochondrial
[2928.8s - 2933.3s]: function and then you start depleting
[2930.5s - 2936.1s]: mitochondria and and and then yeah and
[2933.3s - 2938.0s]: then you actually the mitochondria begin
[2936.1s - 2940.2s]: producing more more reactive oxygen
[2938.0s - 2942.8s]: species which ends up being
[2940.2s - 2944.3s]: detrimental so it's like driving your
[2942.8s - 2946.7s]: car again if you think about
[2944.3s - 2950.2s]: mitochondria like an engine it's like an
[2946.7s - 2952.0s]: engine of the of your car when you're
[2950.2s - 2955.0s]: driving your car on the
[2952.0s - 2957.0s]: highway you don't want to go too slow
[2955.0s - 2959.4s]: and you don't want to go too
[2957.0s - 2962.2s]: fast acceleration is costly and
[2959.4s - 2963.7s]: acceleration is costly right I mean that
[2962.2s - 2965.8s]: transmission systems you know create
[2963.7s - 2967.6s]: this incredible efficiency of being able
[2965.8s - 2969.1s]: to travel at speed
[2967.6s - 2971.2s]: uh with more efficiency you know but
[2969.1s - 2973.1s]: accelerating is is is is a different
[2971.2s - 2974.8s]: thing altogether I mean that's the way
[2973.1s - 2976.9s]: that I think about it and so somebody
[2974.8s - 2980.2s]: who's addicted to drugs and alcohol for
[2976.9s - 2983.0s]: example they're on a roller coaster ride
[2980.2s - 2985.9s]: of hyper stimulating their metabolic
[2983.0s - 2988.4s]: rate and then trying to suppress that
[2985.9s - 2991.4s]: hypers stimulation with sedatives so
[2988.4s - 2995.0s]: that they can sleep or calm down and
[2991.4s - 2997.7s]: then they're just but they're destroying
[2995.0s - 2999.9s]: their metabolic health and does that
[2997.7s - 3001.6s]: really play out like and is that you
[2999.9s - 3003.5s]: know some will say well Chris that's
[3001.6s - 3007.0s]: just one of myriad things that they're
[3003.5s - 3009.9s]: doing to their cells sure but does it
[3007.0s - 3011.2s]: play out in diseases that we think of as
[3009.9s - 3013.3s]: metabolic
[3011.2s - 3016.2s]: diseases
[3013.3s - 3019.1s]: absolutely type two diabetes yes
[3016.2s - 3023.8s]: cardiovascular disease 100% like
[3019.1s - 3026.2s]: premature mortality yeah um like it
[3023.8s - 3028.7s]: there's it's kind of like the elephant
[3026.2s - 3033.2s]: in the room that we have just failed to
[3028.7s - 3034.7s]: look at because we've been so splintered
[3033.2s - 3036.5s]: with no it's biological no it's
[3034.7s - 3038.0s]: psychological no it's social it's like
[3036.5s - 3040.4s]: it's all of them let's look at the
[3038.0s - 3043.2s]: elephant that comprises all of them one
[3040.4s - 3044.8s]: of the beautiful things about science is
[3043.2s - 3046.4s]: that you isolate variables you can get
[3044.8s - 3048.0s]: very reductionist we know that there are
[3046.4s - 3050.0s]: these things called mitochondria that
[3048.0s - 3051.6s]: they move around I mean these
[3050.0s - 3053.2s]: discoveries are are truly incredible
[3051.6s - 3056.8s]: that have been made in the last 100
[3053.2s - 3059.5s]: years or so but there's been this um
[3056.8s - 3062.6s]: kind of obsession I I think in in the
[3059.5s - 3064.2s]: the public discussion around Health that
[3062.6s - 3067.5s]: you know around things that are
[3064.2s - 3070.8s]: obviously related to the thing that
[3067.5s - 3072.6s]: you're trying to cure so serotonin and
[3070.8s - 3074.0s]: brain health it's like oh okay makes
[3072.6s - 3075.5s]: sense you know the listening to proac
[3074.0s - 3077.0s]: what came out you increase serotonin
[3075.5s - 3078.4s]: some people are feeling better maybe
[3077.0s - 3080.6s]: it's through neuroplasticity maybe it's
[3078.4s - 3082.7s]: through effects of Serotonin and but it
[3080.6s - 3086.7s]: makes sense serotonin brain right you
[3082.7s - 3090.4s]: know it um but if we zoom out from that
[3086.7s - 3092.4s]: and we accept because it's true that
[3090.4s - 3094.7s]: essentially all cells are dependent on
[3092.4s - 3097.3s]: mitochondria for their function why
[3094.7s - 3099.2s]: wouldn't we go to this fundamental layer
[3097.3s - 3101.1s]: uh first in order to try and improve
[3099.2s - 3102.6s]: mental and physical health
[3101.1s - 3104.3s]: simultaneously right it's a very
[3102.6s - 3105.9s]: different way of approaching medicine in
[3104.3s - 3107.4s]: general normally we go okay well the
[3105.9s - 3109.1s]: issue is right here that's where the
[3107.4s - 3111.7s]: tumor is that's where the circuit
[3109.1s - 3114.4s]: deficit is this is where the the lesion
[3111.7s - 3117.4s]: is or the growth and we're going to go
[3114.4s - 3119.8s]: there right but um to avoid that the
[3117.4s - 3121.3s]: pathologic state in the first place uh
[3119.8s - 3124.0s]: these six pillars are wonderful by the
[3121.3s - 3125.6s]: way a diet exercise sleep substance
[3124.0s - 3128.7s]: overuse or
[3125.6s - 3132.2s]: abuse stress mitigation and relationship
[3128.7s - 3134.0s]: SLP purpose um so we're going to keep
[3132.2s - 3136.6s]: returning to this theme of of
[3134.0s - 3138.2s]: mitochondria's foundational um
[3136.6s - 3140.2s]: throughout today's discussion because I
[3138.2s - 3142.6s]: think people need to to frame their
[3140.2s - 3146.7s]: health in that context I I really do
[3142.6s - 3148.4s]: also um years ago my postto adviser the
[3146.7s - 3149.8s]: late Ben Baris he died unfortunately
[3148.4s - 3153.4s]: pancreatic cancer but just seeing
[3149.8s - 3155.9s]: incredible scientist um MD and uh
[3153.4s - 3157.6s]: scientist who really popularized the the
[3155.9s - 3159.4s]: study of glea prior to that they were
[3157.6s - 3160.6s]: seeing this kind of like backw science
[3159.4s - 3162.8s]: no one everyone thought it was just glue
[3160.6s - 3164.9s]: for the brain he used to uh stop us in
[3162.8s - 3166.4s]: the hallways late at night and he used
[3164.9s - 3168.0s]: to we called it getting bend because
[3166.4s - 3169.6s]: you'd want to leave and he would like he
[3168.0s - 3171.3s]: was a night owl it was awful and you get
[3169.6s - 3173.4s]: stuck there but I'll never forget he
[3171.3s - 3175.4s]: stopped me he called me Andy and he said
[3173.4s - 3178.2s]: he did this numerous times but he said
[3175.4s - 3182.4s]: Andy why no one calls me that by the way
[3178.2s - 3185.2s]: anymore um he said Andy why is it that
[3182.4s - 3186.6s]: as we get older we have less energy and
[3185.2s - 3187.8s]: I'm like I don't know Ben he's like
[3186.6s - 3189.5s]: someone needs to he's like why don't you
[3187.8s - 3191.6s]: work on that why are you working on
[3189.5s - 3193.3s]: these retinal cells like you you should
[3191.6s - 3195.6s]: work on that and he said why is it that
[3193.3s - 3197.0s]: we that our brain is less plastic like
[3195.6s - 3198.9s]: well I don't know I think it's the Gia
[3197.0s - 3201.1s]: right and there is some evidence that it
[3198.9s - 3203.1s]: has something to do with the Gia um
[3201.1s - 3204.5s]: among other things but there's a
[3203.1s - 3206.0s]: fundamentally interesting question you
[3204.5s - 3207.5s]: look at kids and they're just full of
[3206.0s - 3209.7s]: energy
[3207.5s - 3211.2s]: and we there's the NAD hypothesis and
[3209.7s - 3213.9s]: there's these other but it always seems
[3211.2s - 3215.8s]: to Circle back to mitochondria yes over
[3213.9s - 3217.8s]: and over so I think the answer is very
[3215.8s - 3221.0s]: clear it's it's we have a ton of
[3217.8s - 3224.3s]: mitochondria early in life and over time
[3221.0s - 3225.8s]: it gets depleted is it that simple I
[3224.3s - 3227.8s]: mean there are other things too there
[3225.8s - 3231.1s]: are other things but I I actually do
[3227.8s - 3233.1s]: think that's a it's not just the the
[3231.1s - 3235.6s]: number and density of mitochondria but
[3233.1s - 3237.8s]: it's the health of mitochondria because
[3235.6s - 3240.4s]: unfortunately
[3237.8s - 3243.3s]: you know our cells have a process for
[3240.4s - 3246.2s]: getting rid of defective
[3243.3s - 3249.0s]: mitochondria um it's part of autophagy
[3246.2s - 3251.4s]: there's a sub kind of category called
[3249.0s - 3255.7s]: mitophagy in which defective
[3251.4s - 3258.9s]: mitochondria should be shuttled to lomes
[3255.7s - 3263.2s]: or shuttled out of cells recent paper
[3258.9s - 3265.2s]: actually found that microa in the brain
[3263.2s - 3266.8s]: again send out these nanot tunnels to
[3265.2s - 3269.8s]: asites
[3266.8s - 3272.0s]: and collect defective mitochondria from
[3269.8s - 3274.4s]: the neuron amazing and then take care of
[3272.0s - 3276.4s]: the disposal process for that neuron we
[3274.4s - 3278.1s]: are so cool and that when you inhibit
[3276.4s - 3280.4s]: that it appears to increase and
[3278.1s - 3283.7s]: accelerate neurod degeneration and when
[3280.4s - 3286.8s]: you enhance that it appears to improve
[3283.7s - 3289.9s]: um or reduce neurod degeneration but I
[3286.8s - 3293.4s]: think it is I think children have more
[3289.9s - 3295.8s]: energy because they have healthier
[3293.4s - 3297.0s]: metabolism healthier mitochondrial
[3295.8s - 3299.5s]: function
[3297.0s - 3302.1s]: and when we look at
[3299.5s - 3304.4s]: like again like is there evidence for
[3302.1s - 3307.3s]: that there's overwhelming evidence for
[3304.4s - 3310.7s]: that there are thousands of
[3307.3s - 3313.4s]: peer-reviewed published articles in
[3310.7s - 3316.5s]: leading journals nature
[3313.4s - 3319.6s]: cell all sorts of journals over the last
[3316.5s - 3322.8s]: several decades just to again try to
[3319.6s - 3325.0s]: bring this back to just common sense so
[3322.8s - 3328.0s]: we have these things called diseases of
[3325.0s - 3330.8s]: Aging what are are the diseases of Aging
[3328.0s - 3335.0s]: the diseases of Aging are
[3330.8s - 3338.8s]: obesity type 2 diabetes cardiovascular
[3335.0s - 3341.9s]: disease cancer neurodegenerative
[3338.8s - 3345.0s]: disorders those are universally thought
[3341.9s - 3348.5s]: of as diseases of
[3345.0s - 3350.0s]: Aging interestingly what often gets left
[3348.5s - 3353.6s]: off of that
[3350.0s - 3355.8s]: category are the mental
[3353.6s - 3357.5s]: disorders especially today a lot of
[3355.8s - 3361.4s]: people think mental disorders as
[3357.5s - 3362.6s]: primarily a youth problem but in fact
[3361.4s - 3365.6s]: mental
[3362.6s - 3367.4s]: disorders depression
[3365.6s - 3371.8s]: anxiety
[3367.4s - 3375.2s]: psychosis are actually diseases of
[3371.8s - 3379.6s]: Aging so the Center for Disease Control
[3375.2s - 3383.3s]: has put out kind of
[3379.6s - 3387.2s]: charts of any age
[3383.3s - 3390.4s]: group we what is the probability if you
[3387.2s - 3392.8s]: are you know a youth in America today
[3390.4s - 3395.4s]: that you will be prescribed an
[3392.8s - 3397.8s]: anti-depressant an SSRI
[3395.4s - 3400.9s]: anti-depressant if you're between 20 and
[3397.8s - 3403.7s]: 40 what's the probability among the
[3400.9s - 3406.3s]: remaining people who are still 20 to 40
[3403.7s - 3409.3s]: among all the people that
[3406.3s - 3411.9s]: age as people get
[3409.3s - 3415.5s]: older the risk for
[3411.9s - 3417.4s]: anti-depressant prescription goes up the
[3415.5s - 3419.6s]: highest Cate category of people
[3417.4s - 3424.6s]: prescribed anti-depressants are 65 and
[3419.6s - 3426.2s]: older really well I guess uh some sound
[3424.6s - 3427.1s]: that make sense although I would have
[3426.2s - 3429.0s]: thought it would be the younger
[3427.1s - 3431.2s]: population most people do and that's why
[3429.0s - 3433.4s]: I'm saying this because it's shocking to
[3431.2s - 3435.6s]: most people it was actually surprising
[3433.4s - 3438.0s]: to me but I'm I was thinking wait if my
[3435.6s - 3440.9s]: theory is correct then mental disorder
[3438.0s - 3443.3s]: should be a disease of aging and in fact
[3440.9s - 3445.9s]: they are antis psychotic
[3443.3s - 3447.9s]: prescriptions what age group is the most
[3445.9s - 3451.7s]: like to be prescribed an
[3447.9s - 3454.7s]: Antico over AG 80 really oh it goes
[3451.7s - 3458.9s]: through the roof because
[3454.7s - 3460.2s]: dementia is associated with 40 to 50% of
[3458.9s - 3463.3s]: the people with dementia will have
[3460.2s - 3466.6s]: psychotic symptoms hallucinations and
[3463.3s - 3467.8s]: delusions um they'll have agitation the
[3466.6s - 3471.5s]: benzo
[3467.8s - 3474.9s]: diazines the prescription rate goes up
[3471.5s - 3478.8s]: now with them with benzos there there is
[3474.9s - 3480.8s]: a dip start at age 65 and that is really
[3478.8s - 3482.8s]: because Physicians are explicitly told
[3480.8s - 3486.1s]: do not prescribe benzos to people over
[3482.8s - 3489.2s]: 65 so the rate starts going down but
[3486.1s - 3491.1s]: with anti-depressants it's almost linear
[3489.2s - 3493.5s]: the older you are the more likely you
[3491.1s - 3496.5s]: are to be receiving a prescription for
[3493.5s - 3499.4s]: an anti-depressant anticho discs there
[3496.5s - 3502.0s]: are some waves and shifts women for
[3499.4s - 3504.7s]: example around the time of menopause get
[3502.0s - 3507.4s]: a peak so you get a peak around the age
[3504.7s - 3509.3s]: of 20 which is new onset
[3507.4s - 3512.4s]: schizophrenia and then it kind of comes
[3509.3s - 3515.8s]: down a little and then women round time
[3512.4s - 3518.6s]: menopause higher Peak and then it kind
[3515.8s - 3521.4s]: of comes down a little and then lateen
[3518.6s - 3524.2s]: life goes through the roof goes through
[3521.4s - 3526.8s]: the roof again because of what we call
[3524.2s - 3528.9s]: dementia so the diseases of
[3526.8s - 3532.3s]: Aging
[3528.9s - 3535.3s]: anyway are all of the metabolic
[3532.3s - 3537.0s]: disorders and oh by the way the mental
[3535.3s - 3539.2s]: disorders
[3537.0s - 3542.9s]: and in my mind we need to tie that
[3539.2s - 3545.6s]: together that is not a serotonin problem
[3542.9s - 3547.8s]: right we need to tie that science
[3545.6s - 3550.0s]: together and the only way to tie that
[3547.8s - 3553.0s]: science together is to look at the
[3550.0s - 3554.7s]: bigger picture that we call metabolism
[3553.0s - 3557.0s]: and ultimately you have to look at
[3554.7s - 3559.8s]: mitochondria and mitochondrial biology
[3557.0s - 3561.4s]: to understand it I'd like to take a
[3559.8s - 3564.1s]: quick break and acknowledge one of our
[3561.4s - 3565.7s]: sponsors function last year I became a
[3564.1s - 3567.5s]: function member after searching for the
[3565.7s - 3570.2s]: most comprehensive approach to lab
[3567.5s - 3572.4s]: testing function provides over 100
[3570.2s - 3575.0s]: Advanced lab tests that give you a key
[3572.4s - 3576.6s]: snapshot of your entire bodily Health
[3575.0s - 3578.4s]: this snapshot offers you with insights
[3576.6s - 3580.7s]: on your heart health Hormone Health
[3578.4s - 3582.7s]: immune functioning nutrient levels and
[3580.7s - 3585.0s]: much more they've also recently added
[3582.7s - 3587.4s]: tests for toxins such as BPA exposure
[3585.0s - 3589.8s]: from harmful Plastics and tests for P
[3587.4s - 3591.5s]: fases or forever chemicals function not
[3589.8s - 3593.1s]: only provides testing of over a 100
[3591.5s - 3595.5s]: biomarkers key to your physical and
[3593.1s - 3597.6s]: mental health but it also analyzes these
[3595.5s - 3599.5s]: results and provides insights from Top
[3597.6s - 3601.8s]: Doctors who are expert in the relevant
[3599.5s - 3603.6s]: areas for example in one of my first
[3601.8s - 3605.9s]: tests with function I learned that I had
[3603.6s - 3607.9s]: elevated levels of mercury in my blood
[3605.9s - 3609.6s]: function not only helped me detect that
[3607.9s - 3611.4s]: but offered insights into how best to
[3609.6s - 3613.6s]: reduce my mercury levels which included
[3611.4s - 3615.4s]: limiting my tuna consumption I've been
[3613.6s - 3617.1s]: eating a lot of tuna while also making
[3615.4s - 3618.3s]: an effort to eat more leafy greens and
[3617.1s - 3620.2s]: supplementing with Knack and
[3618.3s - 3621.7s]: acetylcysteine both of which can support
[3620.2s - 3623.5s]: glutathione production and
[3621.7s - 3625.5s]: detoxification and I should say by
[3623.5s - 3627.2s]: taking a second function test that
[3625.5s - 3629.3s]: approach works comprehensive blood
[3627.2s - 3630.8s]: testing is vitally important there's so
[3629.3s - 3632.7s]: many things related to your mental and
[3630.8s - 3635.0s]: physical health that can only be
[3632.7s - 3636.2s]: detected in a blood test the problem is
[3635.0s - 3638.4s]: blood testing has always been very
[3636.2s - 3640.2s]: expensive and complicated in contrast
[3638.4s - 3642.8s]: I've been super impressed by function
[3640.2s - 3644.9s]: Simplicity and at the level of cost it
[3642.8s - 3646.3s]: is very affordable as a consequence I
[3644.9s - 3648.0s]: decided to join their scientific
[3646.3s - 3650.2s]: Advisory Board and I'm thrilled that
[3648.0s - 3651.8s]: they're sponsoring the podcast if you'd
[3650.2s - 3654.5s]: like to try function you can go to
[3651.8s - 3656.0s]: function health.com huberman function
[3654.5s - 3659.0s]: currently has a weight list of over
[3656.0s - 3661.2s]: 50,000 people but they're offering Early
[3659.0s - 3663.7s]: Access to huberman podcast listeners
[3661.2s - 3667.0s]: again that's function health.com
[3663.7s - 3668.6s]: huberman to get early access to function
[3667.0s - 3671.7s]: let's talk about diet and nutrition for
[3668.6s - 3674.3s]: a moment um in recent years you've
[3671.7s - 3677.2s]: talked a lot about the clinical use of
[3674.3s - 3679.2s]: the ketogenic diet for various mental
[3677.2s - 3682.8s]: health disorders and cited some
[3679.2s - 3685.1s]: spectacular results um and this has had
[3682.8s - 3687.4s]: a huge impact on everybody's thinking
[3685.1s - 3689.4s]: about what ketogenic diets originally
[3687.4s - 3690.9s]: were for it was developed as a medical
[3689.4s - 3693.5s]: treatment for epilepsy is my
[3690.9s - 3695.3s]: understanding only later did it become
[3693.5s - 3698.8s]: uh popular as a potential Avenue for
[3695.3s - 3701.6s]: losing body fat Etc but what are some of
[3698.8s - 3705.3s]: the ways that people can use diet and
[3701.6s - 3707.6s]: nutrition to improve metabolic Health
[3705.3s - 3711.4s]: generally but let's be more specific
[3707.6s - 3713.2s]: mitochondrial Health number turnover all
[3711.4s - 3715.2s]: the good stuff that happens in
[3713.2s - 3717.8s]: mitochondria um how can nutrition be
[3715.2s - 3719.6s]: used um to improve that and why would it
[3717.8s - 3721.6s]: be that the ketogenic diet would improve
[3719.6s - 3724.3s]: mitochondrial function or is it that the
[3721.6s - 3726.6s]: ketogenic diet bypasses the need for
[3724.3s - 3729.0s]: standard cellular metabolism by um
[3726.6s - 3732.8s]: pulling on some other cellular metab
[3729.0s - 3734.8s]: metabolism um uh mechanisms I'm I'm just
[3732.8s - 3738.3s]: trying to draw the link here between uh
[3734.8s - 3740.9s]: ketogenic diet and mitochondria
[3738.3s - 3742.3s]: because we've you've well established
[3740.9s - 3743.9s]: that mitochondria are Central to this
[3742.3s - 3745.9s]: whole picture of mental and physical
[3743.9s - 3749.9s]: health I'll throw in a plug before
[3745.9s - 3753.0s]: before I go deep into the um ketogenic
[3749.9s - 3754.8s]: diet story but you you also threw a
[3753.0s - 3757.2s]: question in there about other dietary
[3754.8s - 3760.2s]: interventions or how can diet impact
[3757.2s - 3764.2s]: there is no question diet plays a
[3760.2s - 3766.5s]: profound profound and Central role to
[3764.2s - 3768.7s]: human metabolism and all of the
[3766.5s - 3772.0s]: consequences of human
[3768.7s - 3775.8s]: metabolism and you very eloquently laid
[3772.0s - 3778.3s]: out the case for early life a woman
[3775.8s - 3781.9s]: who's breastfeeding her
[3778.3s - 3784.6s]: infant that breast milk has a profound
[3781.9s - 3789.2s]: impact on whether that baby's brain
[3784.6s - 3791.0s]: develops normally or not that has dire
[3789.2s - 3793.4s]: consequences
[3791.0s - 3796.0s]: potentially for the outcome in the
[3793.4s - 3798.8s]: health of that
[3796.0s - 3801.3s]: child and it's all about nutrition we've
[3798.8s - 3804.6s]: known that for decades that if women are
[3801.3s - 3807.7s]: malnourished during pregnancy it impacts
[3804.6s - 3810.9s]: that infant the the the
[3807.7s - 3813.0s]: fetus's lifespan really it increases
[3810.9s - 3815.4s]: risk for mental disorders and metabolic
[3813.0s - 3818.2s]: disorders increases risk if if your
[3815.4s - 3821.6s]: mother is starving while she's pregnant
[3818.2s - 3825.4s]: or has to fast or has to go without
[3821.6s - 3828.7s]: nutrients it increases that child's risk
[3825.4s - 3831.4s]: for metabolic disorders obesity diabetes
[3828.7s - 3834.3s]: cardiovascular disease um we've known
[3831.4s - 3836.1s]: that and that is um you know there are
[3834.3s - 3837.6s]: lots of theories about obesity around
[3836.1s - 3840.7s]: that it
[3837.6s - 3842.8s]: also surprisingly increases risk for
[3840.7s - 3845.2s]: schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and
[3842.8s - 3849.4s]: antisocial personality disorder and all
[3845.2s - 3852.1s]: sorts of other mental disorders in terms
[3849.4s - 3854.3s]: of other dietary patterns I I just want
[3852.1s - 3855.7s]: to and we can do a deep dive into any of
[3854.3s - 3858.0s]: these you want and then I'll go on to
[3855.7s - 3860.3s]: ketogenic diets but Ultra processed
[3858.0s - 3862.6s]: foods really bad for your physical
[3860.3s - 3865.0s]: health and your mental health we have
[3862.6s - 3866.9s]: just growing body of evidence for that
[3865.0s - 3868.2s]: is that because of The increased calorie
[3866.9s - 3870.0s]: consumption there's this really nice
[3868.2s - 3873.9s]: paper that was published a few years ago
[3870.0s - 3876.4s]: showing that people who um eat above a
[3873.9s - 3878.4s]: certain threshold of processed foods
[3876.4s - 3880.6s]: tend to consume on average about 500
[3878.4s - 3882.9s]: calories more than they require per day
[3880.6s - 3885.6s]: which might not seem like much um but
[3882.9s - 3888.0s]: over time that compounds and they gain a
[3885.6s - 3890.2s]: lot of adapost tissue and and then the
[3888.0s - 3892.2s]: adapost tissue is secreting a lot of
[3890.2s - 3893.8s]: things into the bloodstream that make
[3892.2s - 3896.5s]: the whole situation even worse both
[3893.8s - 3899.2s]: brain and bodily um
[3896.5s - 3900.8s]: but aside from the caloric load I mean
[3899.2s - 3902.6s]: is there any evidence that these food
[3900.8s - 3905.2s]: dyes and other things that are included
[3902.6s - 3907.0s]: in these foods are are detrimental to
[3905.2s - 3909.1s]: mitochondrial Health this is a somewhat
[3907.0s - 3911.4s]: controversial thing these days because
[3909.1s - 3913.6s]: some of these dies were banned recently
[3911.4s - 3915.5s]: which I saw as a good thing but then
[3913.6s - 3918.4s]: some of the die hards in the scientific
[3915.5s - 3920.6s]: Community like oh those dosages are
[3918.4s - 3922.5s]: represent like 6,000 fold what you'd
[3920.6s - 3925.0s]: have to what most people eat you know
[3922.5s - 3926.9s]: the dosages used in mice but but the FDA
[3925.0s - 3932.4s]: still pulled the dies and the FDA is a
[3926.9s - 3935.6s]: pretty conservative body um so I don't
[3932.4s - 3939.6s]: know it I not every chemical is bad of
[3935.6s - 3942.3s]: course um but are these additives really
[3939.6s - 3945.0s]: that bad so to try to answer your
[3942.3s - 3947.6s]: question are the chemicals and additives
[3945.0s - 3950.3s]: harmful the real answer is we don't
[3947.6s - 3953.4s]: actually have adequate scientific
[3950.3s - 3955.1s]: evidence one way or another and why
[3953.4s - 3957.4s]: don't we have adequate scientific
[3955.1s - 3961.2s]: evidence because we're not
[3957.4s - 3963.5s]: spending money to research it so right
[3961.2s - 3969.0s]: now the the
[3963.5s - 3971.3s]: rules to this day are that um you know
[3969.0s - 3975.1s]: there's this concept called grass
[3971.3s - 3978.6s]: General regarded as safe that food
[3975.1s - 3982.3s]: companies can develop new
[3978.6s - 3986.6s]: molecules that will preserve a food make
[3982.3s - 3989.0s]: a food hyper palatable make it tastier
[3986.6s - 3990.9s]: make it more shelf stable whatever
[3989.0s - 3993.8s]: whatever they want to claim it does that
[3990.9s - 3996.4s]: they can develop
[3993.8s - 3997.7s]: molecules they can put these molecules
[3996.4s - 4000.2s]: into our
[3997.7s - 4002.3s]: food and they can get away with just
[4000.2s - 4006.0s]: saying well this is just general
[4002.3s - 4009.2s]: regarded as safe without any adequate
[4006.0s - 4013.4s]: safety testing whatsoever and the FDA
[4009.2s - 4016.4s]: allows that now the new new
[4013.4s - 4019.2s]: Administration RFK Jr just ly said he's
[4016.4s - 4021.2s]: going to try to change that rule and I
[4019.2s - 4023.9s]: welcome that change I think that will be
[4021.2s - 4027.4s]: a phenomenal
[4023.9s - 4029.1s]: change but the re so the reality is that
[4027.4s - 4030.8s]: testing hasn't been done on all of these
[4029.1s - 4034.3s]: molecules there are tens of thousands of
[4030.8s - 4036.1s]: molecules and like new chemicals new
[4034.3s - 4040.9s]: additives things that sometimes aren't
[4036.1s - 4042.9s]: even on the label that are added to food
[4040.9s - 4045.6s]: and we really don't know for
[4042.9s - 4048.2s]: sure for each and every one of them
[4045.6s - 4050.6s]: whether this one is safe or not safe
[4048.2s - 4052.9s]: what we do know overall and this
[4050.6s - 4055.6s]: unfortunately comes down to
[4052.9s - 4058.2s]: epidemiological studies where they just
[4055.6s - 4059.6s]: look at hundreds of thousands if not
[4058.2s - 4063.6s]: millions of
[4059.6s - 4065.4s]: people and they assess like how much
[4063.6s - 4069.4s]: Ultra processed
[4065.4s - 4071.7s]: food is this person eating and is that
[4069.4s - 4074.6s]: Associated if we look at large
[4071.7s - 4077.3s]: populations of people and we stratify
[4074.6s - 4080.3s]: them by the these these people are
[4077.3s - 4083.2s]: eating Mo mostly Ultra processed foods
[4080.3s - 4085.6s]: and these people are hardly eating any
[4083.2s - 4089.0s]: are there differences in their health
[4085.6s - 4092.7s]: outcomes and the answer to that is
[4089.0s - 4095.3s]: unequivocal and it is perfectly clear
[4092.7s - 4098.0s]: the more Ultra processed foods you eat
[4095.3s - 4102.0s]: the worse your physical and mental
[4098.0s - 4105.5s]: health both its cardiovascular disease
[4102.0s - 4109.3s]: its obesity its diabetes its mortality
[4105.5s - 4111.1s]: it's cancer it's also a broad range of
[4109.3s - 4114.9s]: mental
[4111.1s - 4118.4s]: disorders and so we know that we we've
[4114.9s - 4120.9s]: got more granular data that's hyper
[4118.4s - 4124.3s]: focuses on the mental health story you
[4120.9s - 4127.3s]: know one study over 300,000 people the
[4124.3s - 4129.0s]: more Ultra processed foods you eat a
[4127.3s - 4132.3s]: direct linear relationship it was
[4129.0s - 4134.6s]: shocking how linear it was the more
[4132.3s - 4136.2s]: Ultra processed foods you eat the worse
[4134.6s - 4138.8s]: your mental health
[4136.2s - 4140.4s]: and it was so striking it was not a
[4138.8s - 4144.1s]: subtle difference it wasn't like you
[4140.4s - 4148.0s]: know oh it was a 3% difference between
[4144.1s - 4153.0s]: the lowest it was a threefold difference
[4148.0s - 4155.0s]: wow the people who consumed Ultra
[4153.0s - 4155.9s]: processed foods every day multiple times
[4155.0s - 4161.4s]: a
[4155.9s - 4162.9s]: day 58% of them had poor mental health
[4161.4s - 4167.0s]: compared to only
[4162.9s - 4169.8s]: 18% of the people who rarely or never
[4167.0s - 4171.8s]: consumed Ultra processed foods wow so
[4169.8s - 4175.3s]: this would be even just like somebody
[4171.8s - 4177.4s]: has like a bag of chips and some um you
[4175.3s - 4179.6s]: know just pour in water type pre-made
[4177.4s - 4183.4s]: soup or something like that uh those are
[4179.6s - 4185.5s]: ultr processed um this would be somebody
[4183.4s - 4187.1s]: orders a sandwich at the deli for lunch
[4185.5s - 4188.8s]: which can be done in a relatively
[4187.1s - 4193.4s]: healthy way depending on what's in that
[4188.8s - 4195.1s]: sandwich um and then does soda and bag
[4193.4s - 4197.5s]: of chips on the side like I mean you're
[4195.1s - 4199.5s]: that's a lot of in my opinion highly
[4197.5s - 4201.8s]: processed food but people I think
[4199.5s - 4205.0s]: sometimes people don't think of it that
[4201.8s - 4206.4s]: way yes one of I was um surprised and
[4205.0s - 4211.1s]: somewhat delighted to learn that one of
[4206.4s - 4214.9s]: the ways that um the you know the public
[4211.1s - 4216.4s]: health uh folks uh got kids to smoke
[4214.9s - 4218.5s]: fewer cigarettes because when I was
[4216.4s - 4219.8s]: growing up like smoking was cool like
[4218.5s - 4221.7s]: you smoke cigarette it was cool people
[4219.8s - 4223.3s]: thought it was cool definitely is
[4221.7s - 4225.5s]: reinforcing because of the nicotine the
[4223.3s - 4227.6s]: dopamine increases um and it was
[4225.5s - 4230.0s]: considered cool um you had your like
[4227.6s - 4232.5s]: maror man image from the preceding
[4230.0s - 4235.6s]: decades but then it was really the the
[4232.5s - 4237.5s]: uh the 9s kind of um it was the actors
[4235.6s - 4238.9s]: and models and stuff that made it cool
[4237.5s - 4241.6s]: like people smoked and it was supposed
[4238.9s - 4245.0s]: to be cool and one of the ways that
[4241.6s - 4247.8s]: um we ended up with people smoking far
[4245.0s - 4249.2s]: less was not just to ban it on campuses
[4247.8s - 4250.8s]: because that just makes teens want to do
[4249.2s - 4253.9s]: it more right in college you want to do
[4250.8s - 4256.2s]: it more um was to have these commercials
[4253.9s - 4258.6s]: of these um
[4256.2s - 4264.7s]: it was all to be direct it was just like
[4258.6s - 4266.6s]: these um rich white guys in a room that
[4264.7s - 4267.9s]: was portraying like the boardroom of a
[4266.6s - 4269.8s]: tobacco company and they were like
[4267.9s - 4271.3s]: cackling and talking about like haahha
[4269.8s - 4272.8s]: they think we're going to they don't
[4271.3s - 4275.2s]: think it causes cancer and this kind of
[4272.8s - 4277.8s]: thing basically pitting youth against
[4275.2s - 4279.8s]: adults so that the youth felt like their
[4277.8s - 4283.4s]: money was being taken by the by The
[4279.8s - 4286.2s]: Establishment so is there a world where
[4283.4s - 4287.7s]: you know kids are going to be like like
[4286.2s - 4290.3s]: you know forgive me but you know like f
[4287.7s - 4291.9s]: that I'm not eating Doritos you know
[4290.3s - 4293.5s]: like I'm not going to be manipulated by
[4291.9s - 4295.5s]: highly processed foods or I'm going to
[4293.5s - 4297.2s]: hold on to my mental health by making
[4295.5s - 4298.7s]: healthy choices in terms of food It's
[4297.2s - 4301.0s]: Tricky but it has a lot of the same
[4298.7s - 4303.2s]: parallels to cigarette use or alcohol
[4301.0s - 4305.0s]: use but I feel like the only way to
[4303.2s - 4307.0s]: really get Americans to change their
[4305.0s - 4309.3s]: behavior besides scaring them
[4307.0s - 4311.2s]: fundamentally but even if you do that is
[4309.3s - 4312.7s]: to incentivize it and one of the best
[4311.2s - 4315.9s]: incentives historically for public
[4312.7s - 4317.2s]: health change has been to pit the make
[4315.9s - 4318.3s]: the public feel like they're pitted
[4317.2s - 4320.5s]: against the people that are trying to
[4318.3s - 4322.4s]: take their money unfairly and make them
[4320.5s - 4324.6s]: unhealthy at the same time you got to
[4322.4s - 4327.0s]: activate that kind of rebellious Spirit
[4324.6s - 4329.3s]: uh-uh not going to do it just telling
[4327.0s - 4331.8s]: people is bad for you doesn't work right
[4329.3s - 4333.8s]: we know that how do we incentivize
[4331.8s - 4336.2s]: people yeah I'm not going to give a
[4333.8s - 4338.7s]: cliche answer because this is the
[4336.2s - 4341.6s]: trillion dollar question that
[4338.7s - 4345.3s]: everybody's asking
[4341.6s - 4346.9s]: and and it it really you know the the
[4345.3s - 4350.0s]: health of our
[4346.9s - 4352.2s]: country really kind of depends on it
[4350.0s - 4354.4s]: with billions of
[4352.2s - 4358.8s]: dollars that this
[4354.4s - 4361.2s]: industry has in Revenue
[4358.8s - 4364.3s]: annually they can spend a lot of that
[4361.2s - 4366.8s]: money on really impactful marketing
[4364.3s - 4371.2s]: campaigns getting people to believe that
[4366.8s - 4373.8s]: it's not it's not as unhealthy as Chris
[4371.2s - 4375.6s]: Palmer and Andrew huberman are saying
[4373.8s - 4377.4s]: it's fine
[4375.6s - 4381.1s]: everybody deserves a
[4377.4s - 4383.6s]: treat within the last couple of weeks
[4381.1s - 4387.8s]: the American Heart
[4383.6s - 4392.1s]: Association was actively lobbying
[4387.8s - 4396.1s]: against a Texas bill that was trying to
[4392.1s - 4399.0s]: restrict spending food stamp money on
[4396.1s - 4400.6s]: junk food I saw that clip it's so
[4399.0s - 4402.0s]: disturbing to see someone from the
[4400.6s - 4405.2s]: American Heart
[4402.0s - 4408.4s]: Association actively lobbying to keep
[4405.2s - 4410.3s]: tax dollars directed towards including
[4408.4s - 4415.2s]: sugary soda not even diet soda but
[4410.3s - 4418.1s]: sugary soda in uh lunches and and food
[4415.2s - 4420.3s]: for people who are uh low income and he
[4418.1s - 4421.5s]: went on record as
[4420.3s - 4424.1s]: [Music]
[4421.5s - 4426.7s]: saying this junk food this Ultra
[4424.1s - 4428.8s]: processed food is not the root cause of
[4426.7s - 4429.9s]: obesity or diabetes or any of these
[4428.8s - 4433.1s]: health
[4429.9s - 4435.2s]: conditions which is an absolute abject
[4433.1s - 4441.4s]: lie
[4435.2s - 4445.7s]: and when you have supposedly respected
[4441.4s - 4445.7s]: organizations being bought by
[4445.9s - 4450.5s]: industry
[4447.5s - 4450.5s]: promoting
[4452.0s - 4457.1s]: misinformation I it's really hard you
[4454.6s - 4458.6s]: know everybody's all upset that like oh
[4457.1s - 4461.1s]: people don't trust the science they're
[4458.6s - 4462.8s]: not respecting the respected
[4461.1s - 4465.2s]: organizations well the respected
[4462.8s - 4467.2s]: organizations need to step up and start
[4465.2s - 4469.5s]: behaving in a respectable
[4467.2s - 4471.6s]: manner they need to stop the American
[4469.5s - 4474.8s]: Heart Association should not be taking a
[4471.6s - 4479.1s]: dime from any
[4474.8s - 4482.6s]: industry that plays a role in heart
[4479.1s - 4484.4s]: disease like they it would be like it
[4482.6s - 4487.1s]: would be like the American Heart
[4484.4s - 4489.9s]: Association taking money from tobacco
[4487.1s - 4491.6s]: companies and then coming out and say
[4489.9s - 4492.6s]: smoking doesn't really cause heart
[4491.6s - 4495.9s]: disease
[4492.6s - 4497.8s]: people everybody calm down there there
[4495.9s - 4500.2s]: there's still a lot that we don't know
[4497.8s - 4502.6s]: we need more research we need more
[4500.2s - 4505.9s]: research smoking doesn't cause heart
[4502.6s - 4508.0s]: disease people this is just scare
[4505.9s - 4509.7s]: mongering this is just paranoid
[4508.0s - 4512.2s]: conspiracy
[4509.7s - 4515.1s]: theories that is exactly what's
[4512.2s - 4516.2s]: happening now they're taking money from
[4515.1s - 4518.8s]: food
[4516.2s - 4520.8s]: companies that have no vested interest
[4518.8s - 4523.6s]: in the human in the health of the
[4520.8s - 4526.4s]: population that they are
[4523.6s - 4530.0s]: feeding they know perfectly well that
[4526.4s - 4532.2s]: these foods are highly
[4530.0s - 4533.4s]: palatable um and what does that mean it
[4532.2s - 4535.8s]: means
[4533.4s - 4538.1s]: addictive and again if I was selling
[4535.8s - 4539.8s]: food I would want people to be addicted
[4538.1s - 4540.8s]: to the food I was selling why because
[4539.8s - 4543.1s]: you sell
[4540.8s - 4545.6s]: more higher
[4543.1s - 4548.3s]: margins if you sell food that people
[4545.6s - 4550.7s]: aren't addicted to they'll just move on
[4548.3s - 4552.4s]: to the other food that is addictive and
[4550.7s - 4554.4s]: and then you'll be out of business so
[4552.4s - 4557.5s]: it's not an easy problem to solve I
[4554.4s - 4559.6s]: don't mean to imply it's easy because if
[4557.5s - 4562.0s]: if one or two companies steps up and
[4559.6s - 4564.2s]: does the right thing they'll just go out
[4562.0s - 4566.1s]: of business well I feel like the the
[4564.2s - 4570.0s]: smoking parallel is is critical and
[4566.1s - 4571.9s]: maybe the trans fat um the history of of
[4570.0s - 4573.8s]: entire cities Banning the use of trans
[4571.9s - 4576.0s]: fats for instance or the use of a
[4573.8s - 4578.1s]: styrofoam containers right it's very
[4576.0s - 4580.4s]: different very different issue it
[4578.1s - 4582.0s]: doesn't directly get to human health of
[4580.4s - 4585.0s]: the styrofoams not good but it's about
[4582.0s - 4588.1s]: it's about waste and and um environment
[4585.0s - 4590.4s]: but I feel like there has to be a top-
[4588.1s - 4593.0s]: down ban and Americans also don't like
[4590.4s - 4595.2s]: bans right we don't we don't like things
[4593.0s - 4598.2s]: we like choice but we don't like the
[4595.2s - 4600.6s]: consequences of those of choice and then
[4598.2s - 4601.7s]: we want people to fix the consequences
[4600.6s - 4605.2s]: of those
[4601.7s - 4607.0s]: choices um with treatments that don't
[4605.2s - 4608.6s]: have side effects and then this is like
[4607.0s - 4610.5s]: kind of the cycle that that I've
[4608.6s - 4613.4s]: observed in my lifetime over and over
[4610.5s - 4615.8s]: again you know I think it's the
[4613.4s - 4617.8s]: Rebellion piece it's when people realize
[4615.8s - 4619.0s]: they're being manipulated once people
[4617.8s - 4621.0s]: realize they're being
[4619.0s - 4623.2s]: manipulated I feel like that's when
[4621.0s - 4626.5s]: they're willing to
[4623.2s - 4629.5s]: intervene uh and stop otherwise
[4626.5s - 4631.6s]: reinforcing activity reinforced
[4629.5s - 4634.0s]: addictive
[4631.6s - 4636.0s]: activity save money and like take a
[4634.0s - 4637.9s]: different direction like that's that's
[4636.0s - 4641.1s]: inherent to the American Spirit as much
[4637.9s - 4643.2s]: as we love freedom we also we have this
[4641.1s - 4645.4s]: like no you're not going to you're not
[4643.2s - 4647.3s]: going to do this to me kind of Spirit we
[4645.4s - 4648.9s]: see it everywhere this is my belief but
[4647.3s - 4651.0s]: then again I was kind of a rebellious
[4648.9s - 4655.0s]: team but but if it's in service to
[4651.0s - 4657.5s]: health I'm I'm hopeful I mean my my
[4655.0s - 4660.0s]: understanding by no means am I an expert
[4657.5s - 4664.0s]: but my understanding of what really
[4660.0s - 4665.0s]: drove the reduction and tobacco use was
[4664.0s - 4669.8s]: the
[4665.0s - 4672.4s]: taxes and the ban on Advertising the ban
[4669.8s - 4674.0s]: on television advertisements interesting
[4672.4s - 4675.9s]: that that when you get rid of the
[4674.0s - 4678.4s]: advertisements you're no longer tempting
[4675.9s - 4680.3s]: people with it um you're no longer able
[4678.4s - 4683.7s]: to spread
[4680.3s - 4687.5s]: misinformation um and when you make the
[4683.7s - 4689.0s]: product so expensive people just even if
[4687.5s - 4691.7s]: they want to try it even if they're
[4689.0s - 4694.6s]: already addicted to try already addicted
[4691.7s - 4696.5s]: to it now they are highly motivated to
[4694.6s - 4698.2s]: get off of it why because it's costing
[4696.5s - 4700.1s]: them an arm and a leg Yeah money hurts
[4698.2s - 4704.0s]: and and they and they realize that I I
[4700.1s - 4706.9s]: just don't want this we could do similar
[4704.0s - 4708.2s]: things with ultra processed foods if
[4706.9s - 4711.4s]: Rebellion
[4708.2s - 4714.8s]: education whatever I I don't care what
[4711.4s - 4717.0s]: works but all of the above we're we're
[4714.8s - 4718.8s]: we're really fighting an uphill battle
[4717.0s - 4721.6s]: so Ultra process food that's just one
[4718.8s - 4723.3s]: story vitamin nutrient deficiencies do
[4721.6s - 4724.6s]: you want to go to ketogenic diet you
[4723.3s - 4726.2s]: asked me about that and I got
[4724.6s - 4727.6s]: sidetracked yeah we went into a public
[4726.2s - 4729.2s]: health discourse we're weaving back and
[4727.6s - 4731.6s]: forth that's what we do here I think
[4729.2s - 4733.6s]: it's I look it's very timely right I
[4731.6s - 4735.5s]: don't care if you're the staunchest
[4733.6s - 4737.4s]: Democrat or the staunchest Republican or
[4735.5s - 4741.0s]: somewhere in between like these issues
[4737.4s - 4744.8s]: affect everybody and um anyone who just
[4741.0s - 4746.4s]: wants to view Maha as a republican thing
[4744.8s - 4749.1s]: it's fine that I'm I'm not affiliated
[4746.4s - 4751.1s]: with Maha I I am in favor of improved
[4749.1s - 4754.9s]: Public Health from whatever angles that
[4751.1s - 4757.8s]: can meaningfully be done um so tell us
[4754.9s - 4759.9s]: about ketogenic diet and
[4757.8s - 4761.6s]: then I'd like to ask about things that
[4759.9s - 4764.8s]: we can do to improve mitochondrial
[4761.6s - 4767.0s]: function in these other bins but does
[4764.8s - 4769.5s]: ketogenic diet improve mitochondrial
[4767.0s - 4771.6s]: function and if so H how does that work
[4769.5s - 4773.8s]: The quick summary story for people who
[4771.6s - 4775.7s]: don't know ketogenic so ketogenic diet
[4773.8s - 4777.7s]: is a 100-year-old evidence-based
[4775.7s - 4780.4s]: treatment for epilepsy it can stop
[4777.7s - 4784.4s]: seizures even when medications fail to
[4780.4s - 4788.1s]: we have um over a dozen controlled
[4784.4s - 4790.1s]: Trials of ketogenic diets in children in
[4788.1s - 4793.0s]: particular with treatment resistant
[4790.1s - 4795.8s]: epilepsy we have two Cochran reviews
[4793.0s - 4797.8s]: that came out positive so Cochran
[4795.8s - 4799.7s]: reviews are the gold standard in the
[4797.8s - 4803.0s]: medical field for
[4799.7s - 4805.2s]: metaanalyses um very rigorous and they
[4803.0s - 4808.9s]: analyzed the data that exists and came
[4805.2s - 4811.2s]: to the conclusion that ketogenic diet if
[4808.9s - 4813.6s]: somebody has treatment resistant
[4811.2s - 4815.5s]: epilepsy compared to treatment as usual
[4813.6s - 4817.4s]: which is try another anti-epileptic
[4815.5s - 4819.3s]: medication the ketogenic diet is six
[4817.4s - 4822.6s]: times more likely to result in seizure
[4819.3s - 4825.0s]: Freedom wow than just trying yet another
[4822.6s - 4827.3s]: epilepsy pill
[4825.0s - 4829.3s]: so the ketogenic diet is a powerful
[4827.3s - 4831.5s]: anti-convulsant treatment we use
[4829.3s - 4834.6s]: anti-convulsant treatments in Psychiatry
[4831.5s - 4838.8s]: every day in tens of millions of people
[4834.6s - 4843.6s]: lots of these medications are used so um
[4838.8s - 4847.7s]: so at this point we now have over 50
[4843.6s - 4850.2s]: published pilot trials case series case
[4847.7s - 4855.3s]: reports other lines of evidence of the
[4850.2s - 4857.9s]: ketogenic diet for psychiatric disorders
[4855.3s - 4861.8s]: um schizophrenia bipolar disorder
[4857.9s - 4866.1s]: depression anxiety anorexia or neosa
[4861.8s - 4870.3s]: surprisingly um these 50 reports
[4866.1s - 4875.1s]: represent over 1,900 people and on
[4870.3s - 4878.8s]: balance the ketogenic diet appears to be
[4875.1s - 4881.2s]: an effective treatment sometimes an
[4878.8s - 4884.6s]: extraordinarily effective treatment like
[4881.2s - 4887.6s]: in able to induce remission of
[4884.6s - 4889.6s]: schizophrenia or bipolar um in people
[4887.6s - 4891.2s]: who otherwise had treatment resistant
[4889.6s - 4893.4s]: disorders and they're going off
[4891.2s - 4898.2s]: medication simultaneously some of them
[4893.4s - 4901.3s]: are um so there are you know I have
[4898.2s - 4904.0s]: heard probably from thousands of people
[4901.3s - 4905.2s]: around the world since my work has
[4904.0s - 4908.8s]: become more
[4905.2s - 4912.8s]: public and actually our first podcast
[4908.8s - 4915.1s]: together hands down the most cited
[4912.8s - 4916.0s]: reason people know who I am
[4915.1s - 4918.4s]: as they
[4916.0s - 4920.8s]: should well I know about you but it's
[4918.4s - 4923.8s]: huberman hu that huberman Lab podcast
[4920.8s - 4926.8s]: I'm just I'm just a a a uh a runway for
[4923.8s - 4928.9s]: people to uh incredible messages to take
[4926.8s - 4932.2s]: off thank you again for the opportunity
[4928.9s - 4933.8s]: to disseminate this word and because at
[4932.2s - 4936.5s]: the end of the day I'm hearing from
[4933.8s - 4940.1s]: thousands of people who simply listened
[4936.5s - 4942.2s]: to that podcast made changes started a
[4940.1s - 4945.0s]: ketogenic diet for their schizophrenia
[4942.2s - 4947.4s]: or other treatment resistant mental
[4945.0s - 4951.5s]: disorder reach out to
[4947.4s - 4954.0s]: me you saved my life I can't tell you
[4951.5s - 4956.9s]: how many times I've gotten handwritten
[4954.0s - 4960.5s]: notes emails messages from
[4956.9s - 4964.1s]: people who use those words you saved my
[4960.5s - 4967.5s]: life I never met this person all I did
[4964.1s - 4969.0s]: was share this knowledge and then they
[4967.5s - 4971.1s]: saved their own
[4969.0s - 4973.3s]: lives with
[4971.1s - 4976.2s]: knowledge coming back to your question
[4973.3s - 4980.6s]: now in a roundabout way does ketogenic
[4976.2s - 4985.0s]: diet impact mitochondrial Health we we
[4980.6s - 4988.0s]: have strong evidence that it does and um
[4985.0s - 4990.4s]: so it appears so the ketogenic diet is
[4988.0s - 4995.8s]: mimicking the fasting
[4990.4s - 4999.0s]: State and I just want to say that again
[4995.8s - 5001.4s]: the ketogenic diet mimics the fasting
[4999.0s - 5006.2s]: State what does that mean it means the
[5001.4s - 5009.2s]: ketogenic diet is mimicking no food
[5006.2s - 5010.8s]: consumption so is the ketogenic diet the
[5009.2s - 5012.7s]: healthiest diet that everybody should
[5010.8s - 5015.9s]: follow no that's not the way I think
[5012.7s - 5019.0s]: about it the ketogenic diet is an
[5015.9s - 5023.4s]: intervention it is Shifting metabolism
[5019.0s - 5026.4s]: it is Shifting countless kind of systems
[5023.4s - 5029.9s]: signaling Pathways other things gene
[5026.4s - 5034.6s]: expression in the human body and brain
[5029.9s - 5036.4s]: and that results in effect facts
[5034.6s - 5038.4s]: and the good news is these effects
[5036.4s - 5041.2s]: appear to be lifechanging and
[5038.4s - 5042.7s]: life-saving sometime so they're highly
[5041.2s - 5046.6s]: beneficial
[5042.7s - 5050.4s]: effects um again dose and the way you do
[5046.6s - 5052.9s]: it matter because fasting the the
[5050.4s - 5055.4s]: extreme version of fasting is starvation
[5052.9s - 5057.9s]: and that results in death so that is not
[5055.4s - 5059.8s]: at all a good thing so let's make sure
[5057.9s - 5061.7s]: that if you're going to do a ketogenic
[5059.8s - 5065.2s]: diet or a fasting regimen that you're
[5061.7s - 5067.6s]: not depriving yourself of essential
[5065.2s - 5069.2s]: nutrition that um you're getting enough
[5067.6s - 5071.5s]: calories you're getting enough nutrients
[5069.2s - 5074.0s]: that you're doing it in a a medically
[5071.5s - 5077.0s]: sound way so that you're optimizing your
[5074.0s - 5079.4s]: health and not hurting your health
[5077.0s - 5082.9s]: um but we
[5079.4s - 5085.3s]: have you know it's it's hard to measure
[5082.9s - 5089.8s]: this in
[5085.3s - 5091.7s]: humans in v in vitro because we can't
[5089.8s - 5093.7s]: like do an intervention to a human and
[5091.7s - 5095.1s]: then dissect their brain and like biopsy
[5093.7s - 5099.1s]: it and look at the mitochondria under
[5095.1s - 5102.1s]: the microscope so we mostly have animal
[5099.1s - 5106.3s]: data that supports this but animal data
[5102.1s - 5107.9s]: strongly supports that ketogenic
[5106.3s - 5111.0s]: interventions
[5107.9s - 5113.3s]: improve mitophagy so getting rid of
[5111.0s - 5114.8s]: these old and defective mitochondria so
[5113.3s - 5118.1s]: you're kind of cleaning
[5114.8s - 5120.7s]: house you're getting rid of the
[5118.1s - 5124.6s]: bad and then you're replacing them with
[5120.7s - 5126.2s]: new fresh ones mitochondrial biogenesis
[5124.6s - 5128.2s]: so that at the end of the day the cell
[5126.2s - 5130.9s]: will have more healthy
[5128.2s - 5132.9s]: mitochondria now some researchers have
[5130.9s - 5135.2s]: really hyperfocused on the ketogenic
[5132.9s - 5138.4s]: diet might be working through the gut
[5135.2s - 5141.4s]: microbiome this gut brain connection and
[5138.4s - 5145.9s]: we have some evidence that that is true
[5141.4s - 5149.6s]: so researchers actually took
[5145.9s - 5152.4s]: feces from human children with
[5149.6s - 5154.5s]: epilepsy before starting a ketogenic
[5152.4s - 5156.5s]: diet and then
[5154.5s - 5159.6s]: afterward while they were stable on a
[5156.5s - 5163.8s]: ketogenic diet and then they transferred
[5159.6s - 5166.6s]: these FAL samples to mice who were
[5163.8s - 5170.1s]: predisposed to epilepsy or predisposed
[5166.6s - 5172.0s]: to seizures when they took the feces
[5170.1s - 5173.4s]: from the children while the children
[5172.0s - 5177.3s]: still had were
[5173.4s - 5180.3s]: seizing the mice were more likely to
[5177.3s - 5182.8s]: seize when they took the
[5180.3s - 5185.1s]: feces from the children doing the
[5182.8s - 5188.0s]: ketogenic diet and transferred it to the
[5185.1s - 5190.1s]: mice the mice were less likely to have
[5188.0s - 5192.8s]: seizures interesting even though the
[5190.1s - 5196.4s]: mice were not on ketogenic diets so
[5192.8s - 5199.9s]: there's something in the
[5196.4s - 5203.6s]: feces of children with epilepsy doing
[5199.9s - 5205.5s]: ketogenic diets that result that has an
[5203.6s - 5208.4s]: anti-seizure effect what could that
[5205.5s - 5212.5s]: something be it could be the gut
[5208.4s - 5215.5s]: microbiome but it could be molecules
[5212.5s - 5219.0s]: neurotransmitters neuropep other things
[5215.5s - 5223.0s]: that those microbes are producing or it
[5219.0s - 5225.9s]: could be neuropeptides and other factors
[5223.0s - 5228.7s]: that the gut cells are producing so we
[5225.9s - 5230.9s]: really don't know for sure what exactly
[5228.7s - 5233.2s]: is it so on the surface there's
[5230.9s - 5236.7s]: something in the feces there's a gut
[5233.2s - 5238.6s]: microbiome a gut brain connection thing
[5236.7s - 5241.6s]: what does that have to do with
[5238.6s - 5245.4s]: mitochondria so another research group
[5241.6s - 5248.1s]: did that same model
[5245.4s - 5250.2s]: got mice to have an anti-seizure effect
[5248.1s - 5253.4s]: from a ketogenic
[5250.2s - 5256.2s]: diet and then dissected their brains
[5253.4s - 5260.6s]: looking for what changed in the
[5256.2s - 5263.0s]: brain how exactly is a ketogenic diet
[5260.6s - 5264.6s]: having an anti-seizure effect in the
[5263.0s - 5267.8s]: brain because it
[5264.6s - 5271.2s]: that's the pathology the pathological
[5267.8s - 5275.1s]: finding seizure is occurring in the
[5271.2s - 5277.8s]: brain and when they analyze
[5275.1s - 5281.7s]: genetic changes up regulation down
[5277.8s - 5285.5s]: regulation it all centered on
[5281.7s - 5289.0s]: mitochondria that the changes in the gut
[5285.5s - 5292.1s]: were resulting in mitochondrial changes
[5289.0s - 5297.6s]: in the brain which means brain energy
[5292.1s - 5300.7s]: metabolism in the brain and um so again
[5297.6s - 5303.8s]: it's an umbrella Theory doesn't replace
[5300.7s - 5307.0s]: what we know it's not gut microbiome or
[5303.8s - 5310.4s]: s serotonin it's not gut microbiome or
[5307.0s - 5312.6s]: mitochondria it's both both of them are
[5310.4s - 5315.8s]: true and it's all
[5312.6s - 5320.5s]: interconnected um so I I do think we've
[5315.8s - 5324.3s]: got more than enough data that ketogenic
[5320.5s - 5326.0s]: therapies impact brain metabolism which
[5324.3s - 5330.4s]: then impacts
[5326.0s - 5333.7s]: neurotransmitters a really what I hope
[5330.4s - 5335.5s]: will become one of many really important
[5333.7s - 5339.6s]: Stu studies
[5335.5s - 5342.6s]: um published by Ian Campbell and
[5339.6s - 5345.0s]: colleagues in the UK that uh they just
[5342.6s - 5348.3s]: did a pilot trial 20 patients with
[5345.0s - 5351.4s]: bipolar disorder put on ketogenic diets
[5348.3s - 5353.3s]: and they found in wide- ranging
[5351.4s - 5355.2s]: improvements in metabolic Health
[5353.3s - 5357.6s]: biomarkers like weight blood pressure
[5355.2s - 5359.8s]: other things but they also found a
[5357.6s - 5363.4s]: reduction in
[5359.8s - 5365.2s]: brain um glutamate activity which is
[5363.4s - 5368.7s]: often associ iated with bipolar disorder
[5365.2s - 5370.6s]: and Hyper excitability and seizures um
[5368.7s - 5374.4s]: and so that helps us understand again
[5370.6s - 5377.2s]: it's not it's not metabolic or glutamate
[5374.4s - 5378.8s]: a neurotransmitter it's both it it it
[5377.2s - 5380.6s]: it's putting it together yeah the
[5378.8s - 5382.2s]: Campbell study is really interesting we
[5380.6s - 5384.5s]: we'll link to that in the show note
[5382.2s - 5387.3s]: captions and incidentally we will also
[5384.5s - 5390.7s]: link to this um American Heart
[5387.3s - 5394.3s]: Association appalling uh quote unquote
[5390.7s - 5397.9s]: testimony sorry AJ I'm not I'm not sorry
[5394.3s - 5399.9s]: I'm not uh not sorry um but then again
[5397.9s - 5401.8s]: I'm not a physician so I don't have to
[5399.9s - 5405.0s]: worry about that well maybe I
[5401.8s - 5408.4s]: do anyway I'm not a
[5405.0s - 5410.4s]: cardiologist is there any uh rationale
[5408.4s - 5413.7s]: for people who don't have epilepsy or
[5410.4s - 5417.1s]: don't suffer from bipolar schizophrenia
[5413.7s - 5419.8s]: um but like myself would like to keep
[5417.1s - 5423.4s]: our mitochondrial function as as strong
[5419.8s - 5426.8s]: as possible and for doing a brief
[5423.4s - 5429.7s]: ketogenic intervention yes the answer is
[5426.8s - 5432.6s]: yes can intermittent and I'm so I'm
[5429.7s - 5435.1s]: going to lump ketogenic with other
[5432.6s - 5437.9s]: fasting mimicking diets and fasting
[5435.1s - 5442.5s]: itself so can intermittent fasting or
[5437.9s - 5445.9s]: can cycles of fasting have health
[5442.5s - 5447.4s]: improving qualities or health improving
[5445.9s - 5449.3s]: effects
[5447.4s - 5452.7s]: absolutely
[5449.3s - 5455.4s]: so interestingly before I talk about
[5452.7s - 5458.3s]: even some of the science on this and
[5455.4s - 5460.8s]: there it's not super robust why because
[5458.3s - 5463.6s]: again we don't fund diet
[5460.8s - 5466.0s]: studies there's no money to be made from
[5463.6s - 5469.2s]: dietary interventions really there's no
[5466.0s - 5470.8s]: patent on it nobody cares about dietary
[5469.2s - 5473.0s]: interventions but there are a lot of
[5470.8s - 5476.7s]: studies on exercise interventions but
[5473.0s - 5480.1s]: even those are they're not huge
[5476.7s - 5482.6s]: randomized controlled trials with 10,000
[5480.1s - 5485.5s]: participants they're not you know like
[5482.6s - 5489.0s]: even the federal government will fund
[5485.5s - 5492.7s]: large scale medication
[5489.0s - 5495.5s]: trials Statin studies and others but
[5492.7s - 5497.3s]: they often don't I mean there have been
[5495.5s - 5499.9s]: a few the Women's Health Initiative
[5497.3s - 5502.4s]: funded a massive dietary intervention
[5499.9s - 5504.0s]: study and unfortunately that was a huge
[5502.4s - 5505.3s]: disappointment to the field because it
[5504.0s - 5509.2s]: was
[5505.3s - 5510.8s]: negative they randomized women to just
[5509.2s - 5512.2s]: keep doing the diet you're eating or go
[5510.8s - 5514.6s]: on a lowfat
[5512.2s - 5519.1s]: diet and the lowfat diet didn't do
[5514.6s - 5522.9s]: anything for their heart health or
[5519.1s - 5526.4s]: other objective kind of outcome
[5522.9s - 5528.7s]: measures and put another way just to
[5526.4s - 5531.5s]: just to really close this for people it
[5528.7s - 5534.9s]: means a lowfat diet is no better than
[5531.5s - 5537.6s]: the standard American diet a lowfat diet
[5534.9s - 5539.9s]: is equivalent you get equivalent health
[5537.6s - 5543.2s]: effects from a lowfat
[5539.9s - 5545.2s]: diet to a standard American diet that's
[5543.2s - 5548.7s]: really bad
[5545.2s - 5551.3s]: so lowfat diets need to go away and
[5548.7s - 5553.5s]: people who promote lowfat diets need to
[5551.3s - 5555.5s]: stop promoting they need to get come up
[5553.5s - 5557.6s]: to speed with the science and just like
[5555.5s - 5560.1s]: move on like at least acknowledge there
[5557.6s - 5562.5s]: are healthy fats even though fat has
[5560.1s - 5565.8s]: more calories don't worry about those
[5562.5s - 5567.6s]: calories worry about the health effects
[5565.8s - 5569.3s]: the long-term health effects yeah you
[5567.6s - 5570.8s]: got to get those monounsaturated fats
[5569.3s - 5572.6s]: and you got to eat your Omega-3s and you
[5570.8s - 5574.7s]: have to you know and I'm a Believer in
[5572.6s - 5576.8s]: eating some butter here and there you
[5574.7s - 5580.2s]: were asking me about intermittent
[5576.8s - 5583.0s]: ketogenic or inter intermittent fasting
[5580.2s - 5585.2s]: so I'll just say that we have a long
[5583.0s - 5588.5s]: history in
[5585.2s - 5589.5s]: multiple cultures on Earth for thousands
[5588.5s - 5594.8s]: of
[5589.5s - 5596.4s]: years fasting has been part of healing
[5594.8s - 5599.6s]: rituals
[5596.4s - 5603.4s]: um India China
[5599.6s - 5604.3s]: Christian like fasting has been a part
[5603.4s - 5607.2s]: of
[5604.3s - 5609.6s]: rituals and you know most people just
[5607.2s - 5612.4s]: assume it's religious folklore or just
[5609.6s - 5615.6s]: silliness or whatever but I actually
[5612.4s - 5618.8s]: think Millennia of humans we're not all
[5615.6s - 5621.0s]: stupid idiots and that some people along
[5618.8s - 5624.4s]: the way actually noticed this seems to
[5621.0s - 5627.4s]: do something useful and that's probably
[5624.4s - 5629.4s]: why it found its way in every culture
[5627.4s - 5630.4s]: and persisted for thousands of years
[5629.4s - 5631.5s]: because there was actually something
[5630.4s - 5635.7s]: meaningful
[5631.5s - 5639.2s]: happening so what we have now in terms
[5635.7s - 5643.9s]: of more controlled trials I'm going to
[5639.2s - 5646.4s]: site wter Longo who um he doesn't call
[5643.9s - 5649.2s]: his diet a ketogenic diet although it is
[5646.4s - 5651.5s]: a ketogenic diet he calls his diet a
[5649.2s - 5655.2s]: fasting mimicking diet and it's
[5651.5s - 5657.2s]: primarily a plant-based 600 calorie a
[5655.2s - 5661.5s]: day diet some people are going to hear
[5657.2s - 5663.6s]: that and just gas it's it is proprietary
[5661.5s - 5665.6s]: to him I have no relationship with him
[5663.6s - 5669.4s]: I'm not promoting his product but he has
[5665.6s - 5671.3s]: a proprietary product called prolon you
[5669.4s - 5674.3s]: can get the benefits by just not eating
[5671.3s - 5676.3s]: anything or by eating 600 calories a day
[5674.3s - 5679.2s]: I mean you can you don't need to buy
[5676.3s - 5680.9s]: that proprietary product but because he
[5679.2s - 5684.2s]: is selling this
[5680.9s - 5688.0s]: product I believe he's using most or all
[5684.2s - 5690.5s]: of the funds that from the most are all
[5688.0s - 5693.7s]: of the proceeds from the sale of that to
[5690.5s - 5697.2s]: fund research on it they've done a
[5693.7s - 5701.0s]: series of studies that uh 5day
[5697.2s - 5702.6s]: Cycles several times a year seem to be
[5701.0s - 5705.6s]: fine and
[5702.6s - 5708.1s]: improve a wide range of Health
[5705.6s - 5710.5s]: biomarkers interesting and there's
[5708.1s - 5713.5s]: reason to believe that it may help
[5710.5s - 5716.4s]: improve metabolic Health and Longevity
[5713.5s - 5720.4s]: so he's primarily a longevity aging
[5716.4s - 5724.2s]: researcher he is promoting that could
[5720.4s - 5728.0s]: ketogenic diets also produce Sim
[5724.2s - 5730.6s]: effects I believe they can again it gets
[5728.0s - 5732.5s]: really controversial fast because
[5730.6s - 5734.7s]: ketogenic diets can sometimes include
[5732.5s - 5736.6s]: red meat and then we got the American
[5734.7s - 5738.2s]: Heart Association telling us that red
[5736.6s - 5742.4s]: meat's bad for you and don't eat that
[5738.2s - 5744.6s]: red meat nonsense and uh well that we so
[5742.4s - 5746.5s]: then we get these splintering groups and
[5744.6s - 5749.5s]: we've got the vegan groups saying that's
[5746.5s - 5752.1s]: awful for you
[5749.5s - 5754.0s]: and unfortunately it just leaves people
[5752.1s - 5756.2s]: confused about like what what are we
[5754.0s - 5757.8s]: supposed to do do we eat red meat do we
[5756.2s - 5759.9s]: not eat red meat do we like in
[5757.8s - 5762.1s]: moderation healthy
[5759.9s - 5764.0s]: sources I feel like but in moderation
[5762.1s - 5765.8s]: from healthy sources not the processed
[5764.0s - 5767.3s]: stuff but you know I I get it people
[5765.8s - 5770.1s]: have animal reasons or environmental
[5767.3s - 5772.1s]: reasons they don't do it um you know the
[5770.1s - 5773.3s]: debate goes on and on I've observed some
[5772.1s - 5776.2s]: people who are vegan who seem very
[5773.3s - 5778.1s]: healthy very robust um aesthetically
[5776.2s - 5779.6s]: they they present well if I'm just going
[5778.1s - 5781.8s]: to be direct about it and then I've seen
[5779.6s - 5784.7s]: some people who go vegan and and it's
[5781.8s - 5786.5s]: the exact opposite and then I've seen um
[5784.7s - 5788.8s]: I think the strict carnivore thing seems
[5786.5s - 5790.8s]: to work for very few people but the ones
[5788.8s - 5792.9s]: who love it really love it but even the
[5790.8s - 5794.4s]: folks like Paul saladino who were the
[5792.9s - 5796.0s]: so-called you know carnivore diet are
[5794.4s - 5797.8s]: now then it became animal- based and it
[5796.0s - 5800.6s]: now includes fruits and cucumbers and
[5797.8s - 5803.4s]: tomatoes and um some Dairy and you know
[5800.6s - 5805.1s]: and so hone you know and honey and um
[5803.4s - 5806.5s]: and I like Paul I get along well with
[5805.1s - 5809.6s]: Paul I also get along with Lane Norton
[5806.5s - 5811.5s]: and the they don't get along um but you
[5809.6s - 5814.6s]: know I I think it's it's to each their
[5811.5s - 5817.0s]: own within the context of um the correct
[5814.6s - 5819.1s]: number of calories for a given person
[5817.0s - 5821.9s]: and their activity levels but this idea
[5819.1s - 5823.7s]: of doing a per of periodically doing a
[5821.9s - 5830.1s]: perhaps a fast along the lines of the
[5823.7s - 5832.0s]: longo um uh prolong thing or um or or
[5830.1s - 5836.2s]: total fast or water fast I guess it's
[5832.0s - 5838.5s]: called or um perhaps intermittent
[5836.2s - 5840.7s]: fasting on a on a more um reasonable
[5838.5s - 5842.6s]: schedule are there any data on that like
[5840.7s - 5844.7s]: eating only between the hours of say
[5842.6s - 5846.2s]: 11:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. which is I
[5844.7s - 5848.0s]: which is what I happen to do reflexively
[5846.2s - 5849.7s]: unless I wake up very hungry which is
[5848.0s - 5852.2s]: really rare I don't know why maybe it's
[5849.7s - 5854.1s]: function of getting older but is there
[5852.2s - 5855.7s]: any evidence that intermittent fasting
[5854.1s - 5858.4s]: that doesn't involve entire day and
[5855.7s - 5861.0s]: night fasts but more of the you know Tim
[5858.4s - 5862.4s]: restricted feeding to eight hours or 6
[5861.0s - 5865.3s]: hours that it can be beneficial for
[5862.4s - 5868.4s]: mitochondrial function if it's done for
[5865.3s - 5870.4s]: short bouts of two to four weeks my
[5868.4s - 5873.1s]: understanding of the literature is that
[5870.4s - 5876.1s]: it's a mixed bag when it comes to time
[5873.1s - 5880.4s]: restrict eating and intermittent
[5876.1s - 5882.0s]: fasting um because more often than not
[5880.4s - 5885.0s]: they don't control what people are
[5882.0s - 5887.1s]: eating when they're eating oh well
[5885.0s - 5889.6s]: that's no good so they just those
[5887.1s - 5892.1s]: studies mostly are designed to just say
[5889.6s - 5895.9s]: Don't eat only eat between 11:00 a.m.
[5892.1s - 5897.8s]: and 7 p.m. and eat whatever you want but
[5895.9s - 5899.4s]: it doesn't M like and as though it
[5897.8s - 5901.4s]: doesn't matter what they're eating and
[5899.4s - 5904.3s]: some people are binging on Ultra
[5901.4s - 5907.2s]: processed foods and others are eating
[5904.3s - 5909.7s]: like an adult and uh and then you've got
[5907.2s - 5913.2s]: everything in between as though that
[5909.7s - 5914.7s]: doesn't play a role and and so you get
[5913.2s - 5916.6s]: these studies to say it doesn't do
[5914.7s - 5919.0s]: anything useful you get other studies
[5916.6s - 5922.5s]: that say maybe it does something useful
[5919.0s - 5926.8s]: um so I think I mean at the end of the
[5922.5s - 5929.6s]: day I will say this you know I'm you
[5926.8s - 5933.8s]: know I've been talking a while with a a
[5929.6s - 5935.5s]: really seasoned established um EXP ERT
[5933.8s - 5938.2s]: in the nutritional space in the
[5935.5s - 5940.3s]: conservative nutritional space he's held
[5938.2s - 5944.7s]: several government positions he's helped
[5940.3s - 5949.2s]: presidents and um others with campaigns
[5944.7s - 5952.3s]: and he has made a very strong case to me
[5949.2s - 5955.8s]: that you know less than
[5952.3s - 5958.3s]: 5% of the research budget from the NIH
[5955.8s - 5961.1s]: is spent on nutritional
[5958.3s - 5964.0s]: research the NIH
[5961.1s - 5965.6s]: has an office
[5964.0s - 5967.9s]: called the office of nutritional
[5965.6s - 5970.0s]: research focused
[5967.9s - 5972.3s]: on or
[5970.0s - 5975.6s]: organizing collaborations among
[5972.3s - 5978.8s]: different NIH institutes and
[5975.6s - 5981.9s]: centers and their annual
[5978.8s - 5985.8s]: budget for a major government
[5981.9s - 5989.5s]: organization their annual budget is
[5985.8s - 5992.5s]: 1.3 million with an M dollars my
[5989.5s - 5994.9s]: goodness that's that's which is a joke
[5992.5s - 5997.5s]: it is a laugh joke can't do much with
[5994.9s - 5999.2s]: that and without trying to make this
[5997.5s - 6002.5s]: political there have been people who
[5999.2s - 6005.1s]: have tried to increase the funding for
[6002.5s - 6005.1s]: nutrition
[6005.3s - 6010.8s]: research recently was proposed to
[6007.6s - 6016.6s]: increase that funding to $13
[6010.8s - 6018.8s]: million and it was cut that idea was
[6016.6s - 6021.5s]: killed by the
[6018.8s - 6022.8s]: lobbyists of the food companies I'm
[6021.5s - 6024.2s]: going to get really vocal about this
[6022.8s - 6026.6s]: lobbying through the American Heart
[6024.2s - 6028.3s]: Association thing because I was just
[6026.6s - 6030.0s]: shocked right for all the obvious
[6028.3s - 6031.6s]: reasons American Heart Association you
[6030.0s - 6034.5s]: assume that they are all about healthy
[6031.6s - 6036.2s]: hearts and we know metabolism is and um
[6034.5s - 6037.9s]: healthy weight and activity and all that
[6036.2s - 6039.9s]: is healthy for hearts and it it was so
[6037.9s - 6041.5s]: clear that they were on the take from
[6039.9s - 6043.2s]: these food companies and that's why they
[6041.5s - 6044.7s]: send even just the timing and the
[6043.2s - 6047.4s]: delivery again I'll post to the link
[6044.7s - 6049.6s]: because it's just like jaw-dropping like
[6047.4s - 6051.2s]: I can't believe this it's like it's like
[6049.6s - 6053.3s]: the old commercials of the people from
[6051.2s - 6054.9s]: the cigarette industry saying yeah the
[6053.3s - 6057.0s]: cigarettes don't cause cancer and you
[6054.9s - 6059.2s]: they know it does and and we're just
[6057.0s - 6060.6s]: this is happening now in real time and
[6059.2s - 6062.2s]: um this conversation will certainly
[6060.6s - 6063.7s]: assist in and drawing attention to this
[6062.2s - 6066.7s]: I'll probably do a social media post on
[6063.7s - 6068.4s]: it as well but there's this this thing
[6066.7s - 6070.8s]: that happens in medicine and public
[6068.4s - 6072.4s]: health where the thing that's so
[6070.8s - 6074.0s]: obviously the problem is like it's not
[6072.4s - 6077.3s]: even staring Us in the face it's like
[6074.0s - 6081.4s]: slapping Us in the face and we take 20
[6077.3s - 6084.0s]: to 30 years relying largely on um
[6081.4s - 6085.6s]: messaging through Hollywood kind What
[6084.0s - 6087.0s]: actors are doing what athletes are doing
[6085.6s - 6089.5s]: then people are like oh yeah maybe this
[6087.0s - 6093.0s]: is a thing and then think the battleship
[6089.5s - 6095.5s]: just SL like eventually just pivots but
[6093.0s - 6098.3s]: there's been Decades of horrible
[6095.5s - 6099.5s]: Misfortune and loss in mental health and
[6098.3s - 6101.2s]: physical health people thinking that
[6099.5s - 6105.9s]: there's something wrong with them or you
[6101.2s - 6108.9s]: know um etc etc I mean it's it's it's
[6105.9s - 6110.5s]: asinine it's crazy and so I'm excited
[6108.9s - 6112.8s]: about Maha even though I don't have any
[6110.5s - 6114.4s]: affiliation to it because it it's it's
[6112.8s - 6117.0s]: the first time time in my
[6114.4s - 6118.3s]: lifetime that anyone said like hey let's
[6117.0s - 6119.5s]: actually just talk about and think about
[6118.3s - 6121.8s]: how to really get healthy what do we
[6119.5s - 6124.0s]: know right now and so I'm I'm not a
[6121.8s - 6127.1s]: political person but I think it's really
[6124.0s - 6129.0s]: important um that we get focused on
[6127.1s - 6131.9s]: what's literally slapping us right in
[6129.0s - 6133.8s]: the face with like this is absurd for
[6131.9s - 6135.9s]: forgive me for editorializing here but
[6133.8s - 6138.2s]: we keep coming back to this we know what
[6135.9s - 6140.6s]: what we need to do we know what we need
[6138.2s - 6142.9s]: to do but yeah we have not had the
[6140.6s - 6144.7s]: political will to do it I think the hope
[6142.9s - 6147.5s]: is that
[6144.7s - 6149.8s]: one hopefully of many good things that
[6147.5s - 6154.7s]: could come out of
[6149.8s - 6156.4s]: Maha is separating industry
[6154.7s - 6160.3s]: interests
[6156.4s - 6161.4s]: from the Health and Welfare of the
[6160.3s - 6164.8s]: American
[6161.4s - 6167.3s]: population I think if we can do that and
[6164.8s - 6170.8s]: we can begin doing unbiased
[6167.3s - 6173.7s]: research to really determine what is it
[6170.8s - 6174.6s]: about Ultra processed foods that results
[6173.7s - 6177.4s]: in
[6174.6s - 6179.0s]: harm we know they result in harm is it
[6177.4s - 6182.2s]: just that they're so delicious that
[6179.0s - 6185.2s]: people consume extra calories and it's
[6182.2s - 6186.7s]: still just as simple as calories or is
[6185.2s - 6190.6s]: it that there's something in those
[6186.7s - 6192.9s]: chemicals that makes the foods addictive
[6190.6s - 6194.9s]: or is it that there's something in those
[6192.9s - 6197.8s]: chemicals that actually impairs
[6194.9s - 6201.5s]: mitochondrial function I think we have
[6197.8s - 6203.7s]: evidence to support all three of those
[6201.5s - 6206.7s]: hypotheses do people consume extra
[6203.7s - 6209.4s]: calories yes you cited one of now many
[6206.7s - 6213.9s]: studies documenting that are they
[6209.4s - 6215.6s]: addictive yes unequivocally they are um
[6213.9s - 6217.8s]: I mean the most common eating disorder
[6215.6s - 6219.4s]: diagnosed today in the United States is
[6217.8s - 6222.0s]: called binge eating
[6219.4s - 6223.6s]: disorder what what are the criteria for
[6222.0s - 6226.0s]: binge eating
[6223.6s - 6228.8s]: disorder it's basically addiction to
[6226.0s - 6230.8s]: Ultra Foods is is really if you look at
[6228.8s - 6234.0s]: the criteria and if you look at the
[6230.8s - 6237.8s]: behaviors when people engage in binges
[6234.0s - 6242.0s]: they're not binging on steak and
[6237.8s - 6245.5s]: broccoli ever like never never are they
[6242.0s - 6248.5s]: binging on steak and broccoli they're
[6245.5s - 6249.8s]: binging almost exclusively on Ultra
[6248.5s - 6251.9s]: processed
[6249.8s - 6253.8s]: foods and then they go through these
[6251.9s - 6255.5s]: Cycles where they binge on them and then
[6253.8s - 6258.0s]: they beat themselves up and they feel
[6255.5s - 6258.9s]: disgusting and they're they're ashamed
[6258.0s - 6261.0s]: and they're
[6258.9s - 6263.8s]: humiliated
[6261.0s - 6266.4s]: and and then they try their they White
[6263.8s - 6268.5s]: Knuckle it to avoid those foods and then
[6266.4s - 6271.3s]: something bad happens in their life they
[6268.5s - 6273.2s]: get stressed somebody cuts them off in
[6271.3s - 6275.6s]: traffic they've had a hard day at work
[6273.2s - 6277.5s]: their boss came down on them whatever
[6275.6s - 6280.5s]: and and then they go home and they're
[6277.5s - 6283.3s]: like you know screw it I hate my life I
[6280.5s - 6284.4s]: hate myself I don't Health doesn't even
[6283.3s - 6288.5s]: matter for
[6284.4s - 6291.7s]: me addic cycle and I may as well just
[6288.5s - 6295.2s]: enjoy myself and just like an alcoholic
[6291.7s - 6298.0s]: would just like a cocaine addict would
[6295.2s - 6300.4s]: um it's not that people are using every
[6298.0s - 6303.2s]: single day you know they go through
[6300.4s - 6306.6s]: cycles and
[6303.2s - 6309.2s]: um it's really tragic Harvard Medical
[6306.6s - 6312.3s]: School just literally two days ago came
[6309.2s - 6315.8s]: out with an article is sugar
[6312.3s - 6317.5s]: addictive and their conclusion no no
[6315.8s - 6319.6s]: because sugar's found in fruit so it
[6317.5s - 6321.8s]: can't be addictive I'm like really is
[6319.6s - 6323.9s]: that and they they actually they went
[6321.8s - 6325.4s]: out of their way to say well you know
[6323.9s - 6327.6s]: like it's not like addictive like
[6325.4s - 6330.2s]: alcohol and nicotine because people
[6327.6s - 6333.0s]: sometimes have trouble stopping those
[6330.2s - 6334.8s]: completely and I'm thinking and what do
[6333.0s - 6339.2s]: you think is different about
[6334.8s - 6343.0s]: sugar unbelievable do you really don't
[6339.2s - 6346.6s]: understand that some people can't stop
[6343.0s - 6349.4s]: consuming Ultra processed high sugar
[6346.6s - 6350.7s]: foods you really don't understand that
[6349.4s - 6354.6s]: like are you
[6350.7s - 6356.9s]: living in an ivory Tower
[6354.6s - 6358.9s]: yes and I'm not but no I'm I'm certainly
[6356.9s - 6360.4s]: not not any longer and it's also I think
[6358.9s - 6362.1s]: important that the highly processed
[6360.4s - 6364.3s]: foods and the palatability and the
[6362.1s - 6366.0s]: accessibility and the low cost right
[6364.3s - 6369.6s]: we're not talking about
[6366.0s - 6371.1s]: eliminating pie and pastries I think
[6369.6s - 6372.9s]: sometimes people think oh like I'll
[6371.1s - 6374.8s]: never have a muffin again I'll never
[6372.9s - 6376.6s]: have a chocolate croissant that's not
[6374.8s - 6378.6s]: really what we're talking about we're
[6376.6s - 6380.2s]: not talking about a homemade cake we're
[6378.6s - 6383.3s]: not talking about cupcakes we're talking
[6380.2s - 6386.8s]: about things that are easily purchased
[6383.3s - 6389.1s]: at low cost unpackaged eaten in transit
[6386.8s - 6391.6s]: what we're doing I I realize is painting
[6389.1s - 6393.4s]: this picture of a little bit of the past
[6391.6s - 6395.1s]: the recent past but what you do so
[6393.4s - 6397.6s]: beautifully is you you're really
[6395.1s - 6399.3s]: orienting us where we are now and that
[6397.6s - 6401.3s]: the fact that we need more science but
[6399.3s - 6403.3s]: we we know an awful lot and there's so
[6401.3s - 6406.1s]: much that we can do and these six
[6403.3s - 6408.1s]: pillars of you know diet exercise sleep
[6406.1s - 6410.4s]: avoiding excessive substance abuse or
[6408.1s - 6412.9s]: use or abuse excuse me stress mitigation
[6410.4s - 6415.2s]: relationships and purpose um which
[6412.9s - 6418.4s]: Center back on mitochondrial Health
[6415.2s - 6420.0s]: could we talk about some of the um other
[6418.4s - 6422.1s]: things that we can do for mitochondrial
[6420.0s - 6423.8s]: health things we can take these days
[6422.1s - 6426.4s]: we're hearing a lot about
[6423.8s - 6428.0s]: creatine what are the data on Creatine
[6426.4s - 6429.3s]: and mitochondrial function or brain
[6428.0s - 6433.4s]: function I'm not familiar with these
[6429.3s - 6438.6s]: data I should be so creatine
[6433.4s - 6444.1s]: is a molecule that is foundational to
[6438.6s - 6446.6s]: energy transformation in cells so creat
[6444.1s - 6451.0s]: goes into the
[6446.6s - 6455.9s]: mitochondria and um there it gets
[6451.0s - 6458.2s]: combined with ATP to become
[6455.9s - 6459.3s]: phosphocreatine and and then it leaves
[6458.2s - 6461.9s]: the
[6459.3s - 6465.6s]: mitochondrian and goes to places in the
[6461.9s - 6468.8s]: cell where energy is needed like a
[6465.6s - 6471.2s]: synapse or a ribosome that's trying to
[6468.8s - 6473.0s]: make some new proteins or something else
[6471.2s - 6476.5s]: it goes to places in the cell where
[6473.0s - 6479.9s]: energy is needed and it can be it can
[6476.5s - 6483.0s]: combine with ADP to be converted back
[6479.9s - 6486.3s]: into ATP so it's basically a phosphate
[6483.0s - 6488.2s]: shuttle creatine is a phosphate shuttle
[6486.3s - 6491.2s]: that is
[6488.2s - 6494.6s]: foundational to energy
[6491.2s - 6496.4s]: metabolism it is foundational to
[6494.6s - 6500.1s]: mitochondrial
[6496.4s - 6503.2s]: function our bodies can produce
[6500.1s - 6505.2s]: creatine on their on its own as long we
[6503.2s - 6508.9s]: have the essential vitamins and
[6505.2s - 6513.4s]: nutrients that make it up and and there
[6508.9s - 6517.5s]: are several of those or we can consume
[6513.4s - 6521.2s]: Creatine creatine is found only in
[6517.5s - 6523.9s]: animal based products animal sourced
[6521.2s - 6530.5s]: Foods um it is not found in plant
[6523.9s - 6534.3s]: sourced Foods so um what we know is that
[6530.5s - 6536.0s]: from because creatine is found in large
[6534.3s - 6540.0s]: quantities in the brain so we can
[6536.0s - 6544.6s]: actually measure it using mass speec
[6540.0s - 6547.1s]: kind of scans and we know
[6544.6s - 6549.2s]: that there's a range some people have
[6547.1s - 6552.4s]: low levels of creatine and some people
[6549.2s - 6552.4s]: have higher levels of
[6552.9s - 6557.4s]: creatine people who consume less animal
[6555.8s - 6559.5s]: sourced foods like vegans and
[6557.4s - 6562.7s]: vegetarians on average tend to have
[6559.5s - 6564.4s]: lower levels of creatine in their brain
[6562.7s - 6566.0s]: and muscles and other
[6564.4s - 6571.0s]: tissues
[6566.0s - 6574.0s]: um people with neuros psychiatric
[6571.0s - 6576.8s]: disorders schizophrenia Alzheimer's
[6574.0s - 6579.4s]: disease depression have been found to
[6576.8s - 6582.5s]: have lower levels of
[6579.4s - 6584.2s]: creatine than people who do not have
[6582.5s - 6588.1s]: those
[6584.2s - 6591.2s]: disorders so we have reason to believe
[6588.1s - 6595.0s]: that creatine from studies like that
[6591.2s - 6597.8s]: that there is an associ ation meaning a
[6595.0s - 6601.4s]: correlation between low levels of
[6597.8s - 6604.3s]: creatine and brain disorders that we
[6601.4s - 6608.2s]: call neurological or psychiatric
[6604.3s - 6611.1s]: disorders so the next question logical
[6608.2s - 6614.8s]: question from a scientist should be well
[6611.1s - 6617.6s]: if we supplement with creatine can that
[6614.8s - 6620.5s]: improve symptoms of Neuropsychiatric
[6617.6s - 6622.8s]: disorders and we do have evidence to
[6620.5s - 6626.1s]: support that
[6622.8s - 6627.6s]: not huge randomized controlled trials in
[6626.1s - 6629.2s]: tens of thousands of people because
[6627.6s - 6632.5s]: again that would require Government
[6629.2s - 6634.7s]: funding because creatine is off patent
[6632.5s - 6638.0s]: nobody's going to make a lot of money
[6634.7s - 6640.0s]: from doing a creatine study because
[6638.0s - 6642.8s]: anybody can sell creatine anybody can
[6640.0s - 6647.4s]: make it and and Market it it's it's off
[6642.8s - 6650.2s]: patent so um but we do have randomized
[6647.4s - 6652.4s]: controlled trial data with creatine
[6650.2s - 6655.7s]: showing that it can improve symptoms of
[6652.4s - 6657.8s]: made major depression it can augment
[6655.7s - 6660.4s]: anti-depressants it can improve symptoms
[6657.8s - 6662.5s]: of bipolar disorder it can improve
[6660.4s - 6665.1s]: symptoms of neurodegenerative disorders
[6662.5s - 6668.7s]: like cognition in Alzheimer's disease or
[6665.1s - 6671.8s]: mild cognitive impairment but again the
[6668.7s - 6674.2s]: studies are on the smaller side they're
[6671.8s - 6676.8s]: not super robust
[6674.2s - 6680.3s]: quality but unless the government steps
[6676.8s - 6683.8s]: up unless the NIH steps up and funds a
[6680.3s - 6686.1s]: large well done well controlled
[6683.8s - 6689.2s]: randomized controlled trial of creatine
[6686.1s - 6692.0s]: versus placebo for any of these
[6689.2s - 6693.2s]: conditions the Skeptics and the hardcore
[6692.0s - 6694.8s]: scientists are always going to say well
[6693.2s - 6696.1s]: we don't have good quality data well
[6694.8s - 6699.0s]: we're never going to have good quality
[6696.1s - 6700.8s]: data because there's no product that's
[6699.0s - 6703.4s]: where we're at as a field do you
[6700.8s - 6706.7s]: recommend it to your patients not right
[6703.4s - 6710.0s]: away uh you know there's more research
[6706.7s - 6712.6s]: coming out um and there's more reason to
[6710.0s - 6715.8s]: believe that maybe I should be right
[6712.6s - 6717.4s]: recommending it to patients um more
[6715.8s - 6722.0s]: often than I currently
[6717.4s - 6724.3s]: do uh it certainly lines up with a
[6722.0s - 6726.6s]: metabolic kind of
[6724.3s - 6728.2s]: mitochondrial improve metabolic Health
[6726.6s - 6730.8s]: improve brain health
[6728.2s - 6734.3s]: simultaneously It lines up perfectly
[6730.8s - 6737.8s]: with that and I just want to remind
[6734.3s - 6739.6s]: people before you focus on what to take
[6737.8s - 6742.1s]: focus on what you should be doing with
[6739.6s - 6743.2s]: your lifestyle what is your diet
[6742.1s - 6745.4s]: nutrition
[6743.2s - 6748.2s]: are you getting adequate sleep are you
[6745.4s - 6750.7s]: getting some bright light in the morning
[6748.2s - 6755.2s]: are you do you have relationships and
[6750.7s - 6756.5s]: purpose in life um uh are you overusing
[6755.2s - 6758.6s]: harmful
[6756.5s - 6761.2s]: substances because I want to be the
[6758.6s - 6763.9s]: first to say if you're not doing those
[6761.2s - 6766.6s]: things creatine doesn't stand a chance
[6763.9s - 6770.2s]: in hell of helping your health it just
[6766.6s - 6773.4s]: does not stand a chance to improve your
[6770.2s - 6777.5s]: health there is no supp that you can
[6773.4s - 6780.2s]: take that will undo the damage that a a
[6777.5s - 6784.4s]: harmful lifestyle will have on you and
[6780.2s - 6786.9s]: your health and um and the reality is
[6784.4s - 6788.6s]: the statistics are abysmal I mean
[6786.9s - 6792.2s]: onethird of American adults are not
[6788.6s - 6794.4s]: getting adequate sleep 60% of the foods
[6792.2s - 6797.4s]: that Americans are consuming are ultr
[6794.4s - 6799.5s]: processed foods you know the real money
[6797.4s - 6801.6s]: is not in the question what should I
[6799.5s - 6804.3s]: take the real money is in what should I
[6801.6s - 6806.7s]: do how can I change my life and my
[6804.3s - 6809.8s]: lifestyle to improve my
[6806.7s - 6812.4s]: health and um so I just yeah I just want
[6809.8s - 6813.6s]: to drill that home for people for better
[6812.4s - 6816.3s]: or
[6813.6s - 6819.1s]: worse I first learned about methylene
[6816.3s - 6822.2s]: Blue from owning fish tanks you clean
[6819.1s - 6826.2s]: fish tanks with them or it's a thing you
[6822.2s - 6828.6s]: use um now there's a lot of interest in
[6826.2s - 6830.3s]: methylene blue ever since a video of
[6828.6s - 6834.2s]: Robert Kennedy putting methylene blue in
[6830.3s - 6836.0s]: his water on a plane kind of went viral
[6834.2s - 6838.1s]: methylene blue has been around a very
[6836.0s - 6840.3s]: long time what are your thoughts on it
[6838.1s - 6843.0s]: what does it do is it going to help my a
[6840.3s - 6846.7s]: condrea is it for everybody I don't take
[6843.0s - 6849.9s]: it I don't take it either and I've not
[6846.7s - 6853.7s]: used it in any patients so far but I'm
[6849.9s - 6857.2s]: very interested in possibly starting to
[6853.7s - 6859.6s]: use it um in controlled ways and
[6857.2s - 6861.1s]: patients who clearly need something more
[6859.6s - 6863.0s]: we're doing all of the right things
[6861.1s - 6865.2s]: we're doing the lifestyle thing we doing
[6863.0s - 6868.3s]: ketogenic interventions or other things
[6865.2s - 6869.6s]: and they still are not well um there's
[6868.3s - 6873.2s]: still room for
[6869.6s - 6875.3s]: improvement uh so methylene blue as you
[6873.2s - 6879.8s]: said has been around for a long time
[6875.3s - 6884.2s]: it's relatively cheap um as a as a fish
[6879.8s - 6890.1s]: tank cleaner methylene blue
[6884.2s - 6894.0s]: fascinatingly is primarily exclusively a
[6890.1s - 6897.1s]: mitochondrial agent so it is an
[6894.0s - 6899.9s]: electron acceptor and
[6897.1s - 6902.8s]: donor so that is what methylene blue
[6899.9s - 6905.4s]: does it can accept electrons and it can
[6902.8s - 6908.8s]: donate electrons so it's an electron
[6905.4s - 6911.3s]: shuttle if you will and how does that
[6908.8s - 6914.1s]: relate to mitochondria mitochondria as
[6911.3s - 6917.4s]: they are producing ATP electrons are
[6914.1s - 6920.5s]: flowing down the electron transport
[6917.4s - 6923.8s]: chain and that is what results in the
[6920.5s - 6925.6s]: production of ATP if it gets shuttled
[6923.8s - 6927.6s]: through the uncoupling protein it
[6925.6s - 6931.1s]: results in heat
[6927.6s - 6934.0s]: production um and when
[6931.1s - 6936.6s]: electrons flow out of that system when
[6934.0s - 6939.0s]: they leak out of that system it creates
[6936.6s - 6941.6s]: reactive oxygen species which again are
[6939.0s - 6946.0s]: very harmful to both mitochondria and
[6941.6s - 6948.9s]: cells so if you have dysfunctional
[6946.0s - 6950.6s]: mitochondria that don't seem to be able
[6948.9s - 6953.9s]: to
[6950.6s - 6956.4s]: contain the elect R appropriately
[6953.9s - 6959.1s]: electrons are leaking out so these would
[6956.4s - 6961.9s]: be mitochondria that are producing more
[6959.1s - 6965.0s]: reactive oxygen species than they
[6961.9s - 6967.9s]: should does that ever happen in
[6965.0s - 6971.4s]: biology 100% we've got Decades of
[6967.9s - 6974.4s]: evidence that aging neurod
[6971.4s - 6977.2s]: degeneration even obesity type 2
[6974.4s - 6979.6s]: diabetes and a wide range of neuros
[6977.2s - 6983.0s]: psychiatric disorders are associated
[6979.6s - 6986.7s]: with that process the in increased
[6983.0s - 6989.8s]: levels of reactive oxygen species often
[6986.7s - 6992.1s]: referred to as oxidative stress so we
[6989.8s - 6996.0s]: got Decades of evidence strongly
[6992.1s - 6997.9s]: supporting that um Can methylene blue
[6996.0s - 7000.3s]: play a role in that absolutely because
[6997.9s - 7003.1s]: methylene blue can come in and take some
[7000.3s - 7004.7s]: of these Wayward
[7003.1s - 7008.4s]: electrons
[7004.7s - 7012.4s]: and prevent them from creating reactive
[7008.4s - 7016.4s]: oxygen species which might help calm
[7012.4s - 7019.3s]: things down one of the challenges with
[7016.4s - 7021.5s]: methylene blue as we discussed before
[7019.3s - 7023.8s]: you can have too little and too much
[7021.5s - 7026.2s]: same with methylene blue you can have
[7023.8s - 7029.1s]: too little and too much you don't want
[7026.2s - 7031.7s]: to accept too many electrons these
[7029.1s - 7033.4s]: electrons need to be flowing to the
[7031.7s - 7036.8s]: places they should be
[7033.4s - 7039.0s]: flowing as opposed to oxidative stress
[7036.8s - 7040.7s]: the polar opposite of that is called
[7039.0s - 7043.9s]: reductive
[7040.7s - 7045.9s]: stress and that too has been found in
[7043.9s - 7048.4s]: people with schizophrenia and bipolar
[7045.9s - 7050.9s]: disorder and some other disorders so
[7048.4s - 7053.8s]: it's really about
[7050.9s - 7056.2s]: disregulated kind of balance between
[7053.8s - 7057.4s]: oxidative and reductive stress and
[7056.2s - 7061.0s]: methylene
[7057.4s - 7063.0s]: blue if you take it in overdose could
[7061.0s - 7067.2s]: become a reductive
[7063.0s - 7072.9s]: stressor um so you don't want too much
[7067.2s - 7076.9s]: but uh so we do have pilot trials again
[7072.9s - 7080.8s]: small not super well done pilot trials
[7076.9s - 7083.9s]: and a wide range of neuros psychiatric
[7080.8s - 7087.7s]: disorders depression bipolar disorder
[7083.9s - 7093.1s]: schizophrenia Alzheimer's disease
[7087.7s - 7096.7s]: others many of them suggesting a benefit
[7093.1s - 7098.6s]: do you know what the doses range I don't
[7096.7s - 7100.3s]: I I don't the top of my head yeah
[7098.6s - 7103.4s]: because I because methylene blue as I
[7100.3s - 7105.2s]: understand has some Mao activity the um
[7103.4s - 7107.4s]: can adjust some of the enzymes that in
[7105.2s - 7110.8s]: turn adjust levels of
[7107.4s - 7113.6s]: Serotonin um which is why I haven't
[7110.8s - 7115.2s]: taken it I've just been cautious about I
[7113.6s - 7116.7s]: don't really want to boost my serotonin
[7115.2s - 7118.8s]: there's this recent study out of a Lab
[7116.7s - 7121.1s]: at Stanford showing that the rewarding
[7118.8s - 7123.6s]: properties of various things as we know
[7121.1s - 7126.9s]: increase dopamine in anticipation of a
[7123.6s - 7130.8s]: reward but also important it seems these
[7126.9s - 7133.5s]: are Mouse studies but serotonin drops as
[7130.8s - 7136.7s]: dopamine goes up and that drop in
[7133.5s - 7138.0s]: serotonin is at least as important as
[7136.7s - 7140.5s]: the increase in dopamine for the
[7138.0s - 7144.3s]: reinforcing properties of certain
[7140.5s - 7146.8s]: behaviors and substances and um I I'm
[7144.3s - 7148.9s]: very reluctant to tamper with anything
[7146.8s - 7152.3s]: that would raise serotonin because in
[7148.9s - 7154.6s]: these studies um or these experiments I
[7152.3s - 7157.2s]: or in these experiments I should
[7154.6s - 7159.8s]: say increasing
[7157.2s - 7162.5s]: serotonin uh offset some of the
[7159.8s - 7165.3s]: rewarding aspects of
[7162.5s - 7166.6s]: otherwise rewarding things so I want
[7165.3s - 7168.6s]: things that are rewarding to feel
[7166.6s - 7170.4s]: rewarding and so this this difference
[7168.6s - 7172.2s]: between dopamine and serotonin seems
[7170.4s - 7174.2s]: pretty vital I mean that's not to say
[7172.2s - 7176.5s]: I'm like terrified of anything that
[7174.2s - 7178.7s]: increases serotonin but to do it
[7176.5s - 7180.1s]: pharmacologically just seems a little
[7178.7s - 7181.7s]: little sketchy given I don't have a
[7180.1s - 7183.4s]: clinical need that I'm at least not that
[7181.7s - 7186.6s]: aware of no well and that's actually one
[7183.4s - 7189.0s]: of the warnings with um methylene blue
[7186.6s - 7190.6s]: is that if you if taken in to have a
[7189.0s - 7192.0s]: dose you can actually get serotonin
[7190.6s - 7193.9s]: syndrome could you explain what ser
[7192.0s - 7198.1s]: serotonin syndrome is so serotonin
[7193.9s - 7201.0s]: syndrome is just like really excessive
[7198.1s - 7203.4s]: Deluge of serotonin in the
[7201.0s - 7205.2s]: system more often than not it's
[7203.4s - 7208.6s]: completely
[7205.2s - 7211.3s]: unrecognized really it it gets mistaken
[7208.6s - 7213.4s]: for psychiatric
[7211.3s - 7216.4s]: symptoms so
[7213.4s - 7219.2s]: people can have anxiety they can have
[7216.4s - 7222.6s]: panic in extreme cases you can get
[7219.2s - 7224.9s]: nausea you can get fevers you can get
[7222.6s - 7228.2s]: um I mean in extreme cases it can be
[7224.9s - 7230.4s]: fatal so it's a serious thing but more
[7228.2s - 7232.7s]: often than not it gets dismissed because
[7230.4s - 7236.4s]: serotonin syndrome is most commonly
[7232.7s - 7238.8s]: experienced by people taking
[7236.4s - 7240.5s]: ssris and by definition they are
[7238.8s - 7243.0s]: psychiatric patients or they have a
[7240.5s - 7245.3s]: mental health condition and so when they
[7243.0s - 7247.7s]: come in and say I'm feeling nauseous I
[7245.3s - 7249.3s]: feel anxious I feel jittery I feel I
[7247.7s - 7252.2s]: don't feel
[7249.3s - 7254.2s]: right they get written off more often
[7252.2s - 7256.2s]: than not or giv more medication perhaps
[7254.2s - 7258.9s]: yeah let's increase your dose let's
[7256.2s - 7262.0s]: increase your dose or whatever so it's
[7258.9s - 7264.4s]: actually really tragic I mean one woman
[7262.0s - 7268.0s]: actually reached out to me
[7264.4s - 7270.5s]: who after learning about my work reading
[7268.0s - 7272.7s]: my book she talked to her psychiatrist
[7270.5s - 7274.9s]: tapered off all her meds and it became
[7272.7s - 7277.4s]: clear that she probably had serotonin
[7274.9s - 7279.4s]: syndrome for a long time wow to both her
[7277.4s - 7281.3s]: and her psychiatrist so the meds were
[7279.4s - 7283.6s]: causing the problem and the meds were
[7281.3s - 7287.2s]: causing the problem problem and nobody
[7283.6s - 7290.8s]: really recognized it goodness gra again
[7287.2s - 7293.6s]: so it's uh so anyway methylene blue can
[7290.8s - 7295.6s]: cause serotonin syndrome so I think if
[7293.6s - 7298.3s]: people are going to if people want to
[7295.6s - 7300.4s]: consider using it I would number one
[7298.3s - 7302.6s]: make sure you get a very reputable
[7300.4s - 7305.2s]: source of it make sure you're consuming
[7302.6s - 7307.3s]: it in a way that makes sense I mean it
[7305.2s - 7310.1s]: can stain your teeth blue and all sorts
[7307.3s - 7314.4s]: of stuff so your urine blue your tongue
[7310.1s - 7315.6s]: blue but um people will do IV infusions
[7314.4s - 7320.0s]: of methylene
[7315.6s - 7322.6s]: blue so yeah no that's I've seen people
[7320.0s - 7325.6s]: kind of hooked up to IVs with a meth a
[7322.6s - 7330.4s]: bag of methylene blue do they turn blue
[7325.6s - 7333.9s]: and they I hope not Smurf Smurf but it
[7330.4s - 7336.6s]: is a medically approved
[7333.9s - 7340.7s]: treatment um and I think it can be done
[7336.6s - 7342.9s]: in safe ways again it's off patent
[7340.7s - 7347.1s]: nobody's going to stand make any money
[7342.9s - 7349.9s]: off of doing large welld designed Trials
[7347.1s - 7354.1s]: of methylene blue
[7349.9s - 7357.1s]: um but I'm really interested in it as uh
[7354.1s - 7359.6s]: this as it has these properties in
[7357.1s - 7362.4s]: addition to just being this electron
[7359.6s - 7364.5s]: acceptor and donor um there's some
[7362.4s - 7367.8s]: evidence that it may
[7364.5s - 7368.9s]: improve mitochondial biogenesis that it
[7367.8s - 7370.9s]: has
[7368.9s - 7373.2s]: anti-inflammatory effects and and that
[7370.9s - 7376.4s]: it can do other things that that may be
[7373.2s - 7379.4s]: beneficial interesting very interesting
[7376.4s - 7381.6s]: in fact before moving on to some more
[7379.4s - 7383.6s]: clinical questions we've been going deep
[7381.6s - 7388.4s]: into the science and some Public Health
[7383.6s - 7391.2s]: uh thoughts and Reflections and um
[7388.4s - 7393.7s]: ideas there's a supplement called uthan
[7391.2s - 7397.2s]: a that people seem really excited about
[7393.7s - 7398.9s]: for improving mitochondrial function um
[7397.2s - 7402.3s]: I'm not super familiar with the
[7398.9s - 7404.5s]: literature um but co-enzyme q12
[7402.3s - 7406.4s]: uthan a we're starting to hear more
[7404.5s - 7408.0s]: about these these sorts of things sold
[7406.4s - 7410.4s]: over the counter do you have any
[7408.0s - 7415.2s]: thoughts on those there's a company
[7410.4s - 7418.1s]: timeline that puts out this product and
[7415.2s - 7419.3s]: to their credit they have actually done
[7418.1s - 7422.8s]: some
[7419.3s - 7426.3s]: pretty well-designed robust randomized
[7422.8s - 7430.3s]: controlled Trials of urethan a they've
[7426.3s - 7432.2s]: primarily focused on muscle health and
[7430.3s - 7434.8s]: aging and so
[7432.2s - 7437.8s]: actually have reasonably good data
[7434.8s - 7440.9s]: published in reasonably good
[7437.8s - 7443.9s]: journals um documenting that EUR aithan
[7440.9s - 7447.6s]: a when given to elderly people people
[7443.9s - 7452.3s]: you know people over 55
[7447.6s - 7453.8s]: 65 um that it can improve muscle mass
[7452.3s - 7456.7s]: and
[7453.8s - 7463.2s]: performance within I think like eight
[7456.7s - 7465.6s]: weeks um uh and and that that has
[7463.2s - 7469.3s]: overarching metabolic
[7465.6s - 7472.8s]: benefits that have you know in terms of
[7469.3s - 7476.7s]: biomarkers that have been associated
[7472.8s - 7482.1s]: with um slowing of the aging
[7476.7s - 7484.6s]: process so um so urethan a I think is
[7482.1s - 7486.3s]: definitely a supplement if among all of
[7484.6s - 7488.8s]: the supplements that should be
[7486.3s - 7491.8s]: considered if people are looking for
[7488.8s - 7494.4s]: something to take I'm going to repeat my
[7491.8s - 7496.2s]: myself before you take urethan a I've
[7494.4s - 7498.1s]: said this to the chief scientific
[7496.2s - 7500.9s]: officer of the company um when I was
[7498.1s - 7503.4s]: talking with him about this and I said
[7500.9s - 7505.0s]: but you know that diet and exercise are
[7503.4s - 7507.7s]: much more he said yeah yeah yeah of
[7505.0s - 7509.7s]: course like harder to sell people have
[7507.7s - 7512.4s]: to do the diet and exercise and
[7509.7s - 7515.9s]: everything else but then this could give
[7512.4s - 7517.8s]: them an advantage um and I don't deny
[7515.9s - 7522.3s]: that at all I think it it may very well
[7517.8s - 7524.2s]: give people an advantage um and again
[7522.3s - 7525.8s]: the way that I think about it it's not
[7524.2s - 7527.0s]: that diet and exercise are going to cure
[7525.8s - 7531.3s]: everybody because they won't cure
[7527.0s - 7533.3s]: everybody some people are really ill and
[7531.3s - 7536.0s]: the way that I think about that is that
[7533.3s - 7540.8s]: their mitochondria their metabolic
[7536.0s - 7543.0s]: processes are really disrupted they are
[7540.8s - 7544.8s]: severely
[7543.0s - 7547.7s]: disregulated and
[7544.8s - 7550.2s]: that quote unquote healthy diet and good
[7547.7s - 7554.7s]: exercise and good sleep and good
[7550.2s - 7557.4s]: relationships are phenomenal prevention
[7554.7s - 7560.0s]: strategy for some people they can be a
[7557.4s - 7562.7s]: phenomenal treatment strategy but I
[7560.0s - 7565.4s]: think on average that applies to people
[7562.7s - 7569.5s]: with mild to moderate mental health or
[7565.4s - 7573.2s]: metabolic health conditions that
[7569.5s - 7576.7s]: once once people get into the severe
[7573.2s - 7579.0s]: category severe heart failure
[7576.7s - 7580.6s]: severe you know mental health condition
[7579.0s - 7582.6s]: like schizophrenia bipolar disorder
[7580.6s - 7586.5s]: crippling depression
[7582.6s - 7589.1s]: um my sense is just a clean diet and
[7586.5s - 7591.9s]: good sleep and good exercise is not
[7589.1s - 7595.0s]: going to be sufficient and then we do
[7591.9s - 7598.2s]: need to start thinking about can we use
[7595.0s - 7601.5s]: this supplement or this methylene blue
[7598.2s - 7604.0s]: infusion or even neuros stimulation
[7601.5s - 7606.2s]: which is can stimulate mitochondria and
[7604.0s - 7608.8s]: stimulate neuroplasticity things like
[7606.2s - 7610.8s]: transcranial magnetic stimulation yes
[7608.8s - 7613.3s]: which is done non-invasively right it is
[7610.8s - 7614.7s]: noninvasive and so can we use those
[7613.3s - 7619.3s]: types of
[7614.7s - 7622.3s]: strategies to try to improve someone's
[7619.3s - 7625.3s]: mental health and we've got plenty of
[7622.3s - 7629.2s]: evidence that you know especially with
[7625.3s - 7632.2s]: TMS that uh it can be very helpful for
[7629.2s - 7634.6s]: some people but again is not a Panacea
[7632.2s - 7636.3s]: none of these things are a Panacea and
[7634.6s - 7637.8s]: although I just said that none of these
[7636.3s - 7640.6s]: things are a
[7637.8s - 7644.1s]: Panacea so if you're you know people one
[7640.6s - 7645.8s]: of the biggest criticis I get is Dr
[7644.1s - 7649.7s]: Palmer you have not given me the recipe
[7645.8s - 7653.3s]: to cure my crippling ex
[7649.7s - 7656.3s]: disorder um and it's like well I I'm
[7653.3s - 7659.0s]: trying to teach you the strategies and
[7656.3s - 7660.6s]: the science so that you can put together
[7659.0s - 7664.0s]: your own treatment
[7660.6s - 7666.2s]: plan I am not here to sell any one thing
[7664.0s - 7669.8s]: as this is the Panacea to cure all
[7666.2s - 7673.2s]: mental illness the ketogenic diet can be
[7669.8s - 7675.6s]: lifechanging life-saving it can be
[7673.2s - 7678.0s]: nothing short of miraculous for some
[7675.6s - 7680.4s]: people but it is not a
[7678.0s - 7684.6s]: Panacea I've seen people do ketogenic
[7680.4s - 7687.8s]: diets and not get cured not get
[7684.6s - 7690.8s]: remission and so I'm always looking for
[7687.8s - 7693.0s]: what else what else can we do how else
[7690.8s - 7696.6s]: can we use this
[7693.0s - 7700.0s]: model to further
[7696.6s - 7701.8s]: enhance mitochondrial function metabolic
[7700.0s - 7703.8s]: health
[7701.8s - 7706.4s]: and the reason I think the reason I'm
[7703.8s - 7709.3s]: getting traction is because when you
[7706.4s - 7712.3s]: come back to it the we just keep coming
[7709.3s - 7714.7s]: back to these like pillars of common
[7712.3s - 7717.2s]: sense like for the most part yeah like
[7714.7s - 7718.6s]: Diet might actually make a difference to
[7717.2s - 7721.6s]: your brain health I don't think it's
[7718.6s - 7724.4s]: just Americans I think our species needs
[7721.6s - 7728.5s]: to run up against the guard rails at the
[7724.4s - 7731.8s]: edge of the cliff six times and sadly
[7728.5s - 7735.2s]: see a good number of people go over to
[7731.8s - 7737.2s]: their demise before we go wait a
[7735.2s - 7739.6s]: second we need to think about how fast
[7737.2s - 7740.7s]: we're taking these turns we need to pull
[7739.6s - 7742.0s]: back I mean there's something weird
[7740.7s - 7746.1s]: about our species that we love to
[7742.0s - 7748.3s]: develop technology and then uh and then
[7746.1s - 7749.9s]: find the destructive aspects of those
[7748.3s - 7751.5s]: technology then pull back and a lot of
[7749.9s - 7754.0s]: our you know it's like two steps forward
[7751.5s - 7756.4s]: one step back type Evolution it seems
[7754.0s - 7758.6s]: inherent to Homo sapiens I'm forgive me
[7756.4s - 7760.6s]: for getting so macroscopic here but when
[7758.6s - 7762.2s]: you look through I I there's a wonderful
[7760.6s - 7764.0s]: book The Prince of men medicine or
[7762.2s - 7766.6s]: history of medicine Galen and like it
[7764.0s - 7768.4s]: starts there and all the way forward and
[7766.6s - 7770.0s]: you read like The what is it the Emperor
[7768.4s - 7772.1s]: of all maladies about cancer and you
[7770.0s - 7773.6s]: just realize like we're we're stumbling
[7772.1s - 7776.7s]: forward and making
[7773.6s - 7777.6s]: miraculous progress and at the same time
[7776.7s - 7779.6s]: we
[7777.6s - 7782.0s]: are
[7779.6s - 7783.8s]: seemingly deliberately overlooking a lot
[7782.0s - 7787.0s]: of the stuff that's just obvious it's
[7783.8s - 7788.7s]: like the the old advice as we exit this
[7787.0s - 7791.4s]: conversation about supplements the the
[7788.7s - 7793.6s]: the old advice that if you just eat a
[7791.4s - 7795.7s]: balanced diet you're good doesn't work
[7793.6s - 7797.3s]: anymore I noticed that because quote
[7795.7s - 7801.0s]: unquote balanced diet first of all no
[7797.3s - 7802.8s]: one can agree on that uh and people get
[7801.0s - 7804.4s]: caught up in the vegetarian versus
[7802.8s - 7806.0s]: carnivore debates which are really like
[7804.4s - 7808.7s]: or vegan versus car which are really at
[7806.0s - 7810.6s]: the extremes so we we've lost our our
[7808.7s - 7815.0s]: bearings we're kind of like like True
[7810.6s - 7817.5s]: North is so clear what true north is
[7815.0s - 7819.4s]: it's mostly nonprocessed minimally
[7817.5s - 7821.0s]: processed foods getting adequate quality
[7819.4s - 7822.4s]: protein you could do that vegetarian you
[7821.0s - 7824.6s]: could do that with some animal- based
[7822.4s - 7827.0s]: products if you if you choose it's doing
[7824.6s - 7829.0s]: that for 90% or 80% of one's nutrition
[7827.0s - 7830.8s]: it's exercise we know what forms like
[7829.0s - 7832.9s]: all the information's there as you're
[7830.8s - 7834.9s]: pointing out but somehow we're just
[7832.9s - 7839.3s]: going to have to keep putting it back in
[7834.9s - 7841.5s]: our faces um or see enough unfortunate
[7839.3s - 7842.7s]: stuff that we we away a second like that
[7841.5s - 7844.1s]: this is it's time for a course
[7842.7s - 7846.1s]: correction but hey that's what we're
[7844.1s - 7849.9s]: trying to do here right absolutely and
[7846.1s - 7851.9s]: we have um we have uh colleagues to do
[7849.9s - 7854.2s]: it as well and I'll just throw in as
[7851.9s - 7856.0s]: long as we're editorializing a lot today
[7854.2s - 7858.3s]: I think in The Last 5 Years the
[7856.0s - 7860.4s]: discourse around Public Health from the
[7858.3s - 7862.8s]: mental health side from the Cardiology
[7860.4s - 7865.0s]: side from the cancer side from the long
[7862.8s - 7868.0s]: has really transformed in no small part
[7865.0s - 7870.3s]: thanks to social media and podcasts so
[7868.0s - 7872.9s]: um things are evolving thank you Dr
[7870.3s - 7877.0s]: Huber oh well and thank you and thank
[7872.9s - 7878.9s]: you vitamin deficiencies and mental
[7877.0s - 7881.6s]: health it almost sounds like we're
[7878.9s - 7883.7s]: headed deeper into supplements we might
[7881.6s - 7886.1s]: touch on that but a few years ago I went
[7883.7s - 7888.1s]: to a mcnight meeting and somebody
[7886.1s - 7890.4s]: presented some proteomics data where
[7888.1s - 7892.7s]: they were sequencing uh spinal fluid
[7890.4s - 7894.6s]: from depressed patients and finding that
[7892.7s - 7896.4s]: certain depressed patients had
[7894.6s - 7897.8s]: deficiencies in certain vitamins that
[7896.4s - 7900.4s]: could easily be replaced through
[7897.8s - 7902.1s]: supplementation and lo and behold their
[7900.4s - 7904.3s]: depressions were in these particular
[7902.1s - 7906.9s]: patients were being cured literally
[7904.3s - 7909.2s]: reversed going into remission by virtue
[7906.9s - 7911.9s]: of taking the appropriate vitamins but
[7909.2s - 7914.6s]: the issue was they had to use final tap
[7911.9s - 7916.4s]: so it was not in order to know what
[7914.6s - 7918.4s]: these patients needed but it was really
[7916.4s - 7920.4s]: striking I thought goodness we're
[7918.4s - 7922.9s]: talking about B vitamins and depression
[7920.4s - 7926.2s]: so um could you tell us about B12 and
[7922.9s - 7927.8s]: other B vitamins and uh methylation and
[7926.2s - 7929.2s]: folate there's a little cluster of of
[7927.8s - 7930.5s]: topics here that I think is super
[7929.2s - 7932.8s]: interesting and that people really
[7930.5s - 7935.3s]: should know about Visa depression and
[7932.8s - 7938.9s]: other CNS challenges before I get into
[7935.3s - 7941.5s]: the complex part of the story let me
[7938.9s - 7946.4s]: just start with Basics so and this
[7941.5s - 7949.2s]: relates to nutrition that a lot of these
[7946.4s - 7953.9s]: basic vitamins and
[7949.2s - 7956.6s]: minerals um like vitamin B12 folate and
[7953.9s - 7959.3s]: iron let I'll just stop there B12 folate
[7956.6s - 7961.8s]: and iron these are all essential to
[7959.3s - 7965.2s]: mitochondrial function they play a role
[7961.8s - 7967.4s]: in numerous enzymes and other cellular
[7965.2s - 7970.0s]: reactions outside of mitochondria but
[7967.4s - 7971.8s]: they are all Central to mitochondrial
[7970.0s - 7974.1s]: function and so if you
[7971.8s - 7976.1s]: are deficient in these vitamins your
[7974.1s - 7978.0s]: mitochondria will not function properly
[7976.1s - 7980.4s]: so it's at least it doesn't prove the
[7978.0s - 7982.8s]: mitochondrial theory of Neuropsychiatric
[7980.4s - 7987.6s]: disorders but it's consistent with the
[7982.8s - 7990.9s]: mitochondrial Theory um and uh and the
[7987.6s - 7994.0s]: reality is a lot of Americans
[7990.9s - 7997.0s]: are you know a lot of different
[7994.0s - 7999.3s]: populations within America and then
[7997.0s - 8001.7s]: certainly in other countries can be
[7999.3s - 8003.2s]: highly deficient in some of these
[8001.7s - 8007.3s]: so
[8003.2s - 8012.8s]: um Iron uh you know there's a study in
[8007.3s - 8015.6s]: jamama just last year 40% of females
[8012.8s - 8018.6s]: aged 12 to 21 in the United States are
[8015.6s - 8021.4s]: iron deficient wow it really depends on
[8018.6s - 8025.4s]: the definition of iron deficient but
[8021.4s - 8027.3s]: their overarching conclusion based on
[8025.4s - 8030.0s]: what they thought was a reasonable
[8027.3s - 8035.2s]: definition that the journal jamama went
[8030.0s - 8039.3s]: ahead and published was 40% of young of
[8035.2s - 8041.9s]: girls and young women 12 so this is
[8039.3s - 8044.1s]: menstration obviously it's menstruation
[8041.9s - 8046.0s]: they are losing blood they are losing
[8044.1s - 8048.6s]: blood and they are not consuming enough
[8046.0s - 8051.2s]: iron or there's something wrong with the
[8048.6s - 8053.2s]: way they're processing iron so let me
[8051.2s - 8055.9s]: just stick with that what does that have
[8053.2s - 8060.0s]: to do with Neuropsychiatric disorders
[8055.9s - 8063.4s]: well boys and girls prepuberty have the
[8060.0s - 8065.2s]: same rates of mental illness if anything
[8063.4s - 8066.8s]: boys are maybe a little more because
[8065.2s - 8068.8s]: they're more likely to have autism and
[8066.8s - 8070.8s]: they're more likely to be diagnosed with
[8068.8s - 8073.7s]: ADHD
[8070.8s - 8075.6s]: so but for for the most part we'll say
[8073.7s - 8080.5s]: like depression and anxiety exact same
[8075.6s - 8083.0s]: rates puberty hits and girls just
[8080.5s - 8086.1s]: Skyrocket the rates of mental illness
[8083.0s - 8089.2s]: Skyrocket in girls now are there
[8086.1s - 8091.8s]: psychological and social causes of that
[8089.2s - 8092.8s]: yes we can talk about your be becoming
[8091.8s - 8096.2s]: an
[8092.8s - 8099.4s]: attractive sexual mate and maybe people
[8096.2s - 8102.9s]: are you know being mean to you or people
[8099.4s - 8106.5s]: are you know um making you uncomfortable
[8102.9s - 8109.0s]: or you are becoming a victim of sexual
[8106.5s - 8111.5s]: trauma do those things happen of course
[8109.0s - 8113.5s]: those things are happening could that
[8111.5s - 8115.3s]: contribute to depression and anxiety of
[8113.5s - 8118.0s]: course that could contribute to
[8115.3s - 8120.6s]: depression and anxiety again it's not
[8118.0s - 8123.2s]: either or so yes let's stay with the
[8120.6s - 8126.4s]: psych ological and social
[8123.2s - 8129.9s]: causes but let's also go into the
[8126.4s - 8132.3s]: biological causes if these girls and
[8129.9s - 8134.3s]: women are now iron deficient that
[8132.3s - 8136.3s]: affects their brain function it affects
[8134.3s - 8138.2s]: their whole body Health most people
[8136.3s - 8139.6s]: don't think of that is a metabolic
[8138.2s - 8143.9s]: problem but I
[8139.6s - 8146.2s]: do these girls and women can be
[8143.9s - 8150.4s]: thin they can be
[8146.2s - 8151.9s]: absolutely beautiful and thin and iron
[8150.4s - 8153.6s]: deficient
[8151.9s - 8156.1s]: and that means they've got a metabolic
[8153.6s - 8158.3s]: mitochondrial problem that could be
[8156.1s - 8160.4s]: affecting their brain and that could be
[8158.3s - 8163.4s]: playing a role in their depression
[8160.4s - 8167.0s]: anxiety their you know eating disorder
[8163.4s - 8169.8s]: or whatever else they've got vitamin B12
[8167.0s - 8172.2s]: fully we know that low levels of those
[8169.8s - 8174.5s]: vitamins are associated with all sorts
[8172.2s - 8178.1s]: of Neuropsychiatric disorders B12
[8174.5s - 8181.4s]: deficiency for example um is very common
[8178.1s - 8184.2s]: among vegetarians and vegans in India
[8181.4s - 8189.4s]: for example where most people are
[8184.2s - 8192.5s]: vegetarian or vegan 50% % of their
[8189.4s - 8195.1s]: population is B12 deficient whoa what
[8192.5s - 8197.4s]: are some food sources of B12 is it is
[8195.1s - 8200.9s]: animal Source R red red meat basic
[8197.4s - 8203.2s]: animal Source Foods again eggs red meat
[8200.9s - 8204.7s]: other types of meat yep be it it you
[8203.2s - 8207.7s]: need animal Source foods for the most
[8204.7s - 8210.4s]: part or if you're going to be a vegan or
[8207.7s - 8211.8s]: vegetarian please take appropriate
[8210.4s - 8214.1s]: supplement
[8211.8s - 8216.6s]: you can get this in a vitamin but please
[8214.1s - 8218.8s]: make sure you're doing it correctly and
[8216.6s - 8220.6s]: maybe get your levels measured every now
[8218.8s - 8223.1s]: and then at least once a year your
[8220.6s - 8227.1s]: annual physical make sure that your
[8223.1s - 8229.8s]: doctor knows I'm vegan please do a full
[8227.1s - 8233.1s]: assessment of vitamin and nutrient
[8229.8s - 8237.0s]: levels for me um because I am at a high
[8233.1s - 8238.9s]: risk so B12 is impacted by other
[8237.0s - 8242.2s]: medications B12
[8238.9s - 8245.3s]: absorption and interestingly oral
[8242.2s - 8247.9s]: contraceptives can reduce absorption of
[8245.3s - 8251.5s]: or impair absorption of vitamin B12
[8247.9s - 8254.9s]: interesting met foran can impair
[8251.5s - 8259.2s]: absorption of vitamin B12 so just
[8254.9s - 8261.3s]: picture a woman who's
[8259.2s - 8264.4s]: overweight
[8261.3s - 8267.1s]: who's following a vegetarian or vegan
[8264.4s - 8269.6s]: diet who's also on Metformin for her
[8267.1s - 8273.7s]: diabetes who's also on birth control
[8269.6s - 8277.0s]: just because she's at very high risk of
[8273.7s - 8279.2s]: being B12 deficient and what does B12
[8277.0s - 8282.5s]: deficiency do in terms of
[8279.2s - 8285.5s]: Neuropsychiatric disorders
[8282.5s - 8288.4s]: everything it has been associated with
[8285.5s - 8292.1s]: higher rates of depression anxiety
[8288.4s - 8296.2s]: psychosis bipolar symptoms but people
[8292.1s - 8297.3s]: can be hallucinating and delusional from
[8296.2s - 8300.1s]: B12
[8297.3s - 8301.9s]: deficiency and the challenge with B12
[8300.1s - 8304.4s]: deficiency is that the neurological
[8301.9s - 8306.9s]: damage can become permanent so if this
[8304.4s - 8311.0s]: is not recognized and identified early
[8306.9s - 8312.7s]: enough people can be permanently injured
[8311.0s - 8314.3s]: so that's the simple story some people
[8312.7s - 8316.9s]: just aren't consuming enough or they're
[8314.3s - 8319.0s]: taking metformin or they're taking oral
[8316.9s - 8320.6s]: contraceptives or whatever they're
[8319.0s - 8323.2s]: menstruating and they haven't really
[8320.6s - 8327.4s]: figured out an appropriate diet to to
[8323.2s - 8329.4s]: compensate for the loss of blood um so
[8327.4s - 8333.0s]: all of those things can
[8329.4s - 8335.2s]: interfere in with vitamin absorption or
[8333.0s - 8336.7s]: whatever and can result in neuros
[8335.2s - 8339.2s]: psychiatric
[8336.7s - 8341.7s]: symptoms unfortunately the story gets a
[8339.2s - 8343.7s]: lot more complicated so we've long known
[8341.7s - 8346.5s]: that there's an autoimmune form of
[8343.7s - 8349.9s]: vitamin B12 deficiency called pernicious
[8346.5s - 8351.4s]: anemia in which antibodies to something
[8349.9s - 8355.1s]: called intrinsic
[8351.4s - 8357.3s]: factor um prevent vitamin B12 from being
[8355.1s - 8358.9s]: absorbed in the digestive truck so you
[8357.3s - 8361.6s]: could be eating all the meat in the
[8358.9s - 8365.1s]: world you're you can't absorb it and you
[8361.6s - 8368.1s]: can become B12 deficient that autoimmune
[8365.1s - 8370.5s]: disorder increases with age so you could
[8368.1s - 8374.8s]: have been living living a happy healthy
[8370.5s - 8377.2s]: life and then at age 65 you develop
[8374.8s - 8380.3s]: pernicious anemia you can no longer
[8377.2s - 8382.5s]: absorb B12 and this is actually one of
[8380.3s - 8385.3s]: the treatable forms of dementia that we
[8382.5s - 8386.3s]: know of the Cardinal symptoms are look
[8385.3s - 8390.0s]: like
[8386.3s - 8392.9s]: dementia um and the only way to help
[8390.0s - 8395.9s]: these people is if some astute
[8392.9s - 8398.8s]: Healthcare clinician measures a B12
[8395.9s - 8401.5s]: level identifies and recognizes the
[8398.8s - 8403.8s]: problem and then does further testing
[8401.5s - 8406.3s]: for pernicious anemia this autoimmune
[8403.8s - 8408.6s]: form of B12 deficiency and then you
[8406.3s - 8411.8s]: correct it and the treatment is vitamin
[8408.6s - 8413.2s]: B12 injections taking a pill won't work
[8411.8s - 8415.6s]: because you can't absorb it so you've
[8413.2s - 8418.8s]: just got to inject people with vitamin
[8415.6s - 8421.4s]: B12 and it can restore everything for
[8418.8s - 8424.8s]: most people will a B12 or supplement
[8421.4s - 8427.3s]: work like a methyl a B12 capsule as long
[8424.8s - 8430.0s]: as they don't have this autoimmune form
[8427.3s - 8431.5s]: yes okay it'll be fine um and again if
[8430.0s - 8434.6s]: you're eating lots of meat you may not
[8431.5s - 8439.8s]: need any supplement at all so over the
[8434.6s - 8442.8s]: last year um there have been a couple of
[8439.8s - 8445.4s]: Publications that have just come out
[8442.8s - 8448.8s]: that have now recognized a brand new
[8445.4s - 8452.4s]: form of autoimmune B12
[8448.8s - 8454.2s]: deficiency and it targets a protein
[8452.4s - 8456.8s]: called
[8454.2s - 8459.8s]: cd320 which
[8456.8s - 8463.5s]: transports vitamin B12 across the bloodb
[8459.8s - 8468.1s]: brain barrier the researchers
[8463.5s - 8470.5s]: essentially identified this and PE in
[8468.1s - 8472.8s]: people who are having pretty severe
[8470.5s - 8474.7s]: neuros psychiatric symptom so symptoms
[8472.8s - 8477.5s]: of either neurological disorders or
[8474.7s - 8479.5s]: other kinds of disorders but mostly
[8477.5s - 8480.9s]: focusing on neurology because theur it's
[8479.5s - 8483.8s]: neurologists who have been doing all
[8480.9s - 8487.4s]: this work when they first identified
[8483.8s - 8489.0s]: this antibody they they took blood from
[8487.4s - 8490.7s]: these people's veins just like you would
[8489.0s - 8494.0s]: if you were going into a doctor for
[8490.7s - 8496.9s]: blood draw the B12 levels are
[8494.0s - 8498.9s]: normal everything's normal in the
[8496.9s - 8500.6s]: periphery because the person may be
[8498.9s - 8503.6s]: consuming enough B12 and it may be
[8500.6s - 8506.8s]: getting absorbed fine so they're not
[8503.6s - 8509.0s]: anemic they show no signs of B12
[8506.8s - 8513.1s]: deficiency but when the researchers
[8509.0s - 8517.2s]: tested their cerebr gr spinal
[8513.1s - 8519.4s]: fluid they had almost no B12 in their
[8517.2s - 8521.9s]: central nervous system so that requires
[8519.4s - 8525.5s]: a spinal tap right this is not in order
[8521.9s - 8526.8s]: to diagnose it it required a spinal tap
[8525.5s - 8530.9s]: and
[8526.8s - 8533.6s]: um they ended up treating some of these
[8530.9s - 8536.8s]: people with
[8533.6s - 8539.6s]: immunosuppressive agents to reduce this
[8536.8s - 8541.3s]: autoimmune condition and high does
[8539.6s - 8543.7s]: vitamin B12
[8541.3s - 8545.7s]: and some of the people had reversal of
[8543.7s - 8547.8s]: symptoms meaning their neuros
[8545.7s - 8550.0s]: psychiatric symptoms went
[8547.8s - 8552.0s]: away the research is still in
[8550.0s - 8554.2s]: preliminary stages but the researchers
[8552.0s - 8556.0s]: have looked at how common is this
[8554.2s - 8558.9s]: because at first glance it sounds like
[8556.0s - 8561.6s]: well that's just a really rare condition
[8558.9s - 8562.8s]: that can't be relevant to human health
[8561.6s - 8566.9s]: they
[8562.8s - 8569.6s]: sampled just a general healthy control
[8566.9s - 8573.2s]: and about 6% of those people have this
[8569.6s - 8577.6s]: antibody wow it's really high they then
[8573.2s - 8579.7s]: sampled people with neuros psychiatric
[8577.6s - 8582.4s]: lupus so these are people who have an
[8579.7s - 8584.3s]: autoimmune disorder already lupus and
[8582.4s - 8588.9s]: they have neuros psychiatric symptoms
[8584.3s - 8592.0s]: 20% of them had this antibody and then
[8588.9s - 8592.0s]: they just
[8592.2s - 8598.4s]: recently this is unpublished data but
[8596.0s - 8600.8s]: they have looked at people who have a
[8598.4s - 8605.1s]: demyelinating condition of unknown
[8600.8s - 8608.0s]: iology and about 50% of them had this
[8605.1s - 8610.6s]: anti 5% so this is like an MS like
[8608.0s - 8614.4s]: condition had this antibody and what's
[8610.6s - 8616.6s]: the solution B12 the reason this is of
[8614.4s - 8618.3s]: interest to me and we're hoping to do
[8616.6s - 8620.9s]: some research on this in patients with
[8618.3s - 8624.5s]: psychiatric disorders is because there
[8620.9s - 8627.8s]: is a treatment immune supressive kind of
[8624.5s - 8631.0s]: treatments to either reduce this
[8627.8s - 8634.5s]: autoimmune condition and or
[8631.0s - 8635.5s]: high does vitamin B12 injections so you
[8634.5s - 8638.7s]: want to
[8635.5s - 8640.6s]: flood their system with vitamin B12 so
[8638.7s - 8643.2s]: that some of it can get across the
[8640.6s - 8646.6s]: bloodb brain barrier and again oral B12
[8643.2s - 8649.7s]: won't work in this case right oral B12
[8646.6s - 8650.6s]: may very well work in that case um but I
[8649.7s - 8654.4s]: would
[8650.6s - 8656.9s]: actually I mean in these situations what
[8654.4s - 8659.8s]: we know is that these people's brains
[8656.9s - 8661.7s]: are being damaged from severe B12
[8659.8s - 8664.1s]: deficiency so I would probably just go
[8661.7s - 8667.3s]: for the definitive massive
[8664.1s - 8669.9s]: injection and try to try to rescue those
[8667.3s - 8672.2s]: brain cells this is very interesting I
[8669.9s - 8675.2s]: think um people should get their B12
[8672.2s - 8677.4s]: levels measured um a standard blood test
[8675.2s - 8680.8s]: right um it is unfortunately for this
[8677.4s - 8682.4s]: new autoimmune Central B12 deficiency
[8680.8s - 8684.2s]: they're they're working on a commercial
[8682.4s - 8688.2s]: test but you can't get this blood test
[8684.2s - 8693.6s]: right now okay um so uh perhaps to come
[8688.2s - 8696.9s]: stay tuned but I the point of it is this
[8693.6s - 8699.4s]: that I think for the majority of people
[8696.9s - 8701.2s]: 60 to 80% of people who are suffering
[8699.4s - 8703.3s]: from neuros Psychiatric
[8701.2s - 8705.6s]: disorders I actually think using
[8703.3s - 8709.0s]: interventions that are easily available
[8705.6s - 8712.3s]: today will help them heal and recover I
[8709.0s - 8714.8s]: really believe that I I stand nothing I
[8712.3s - 8717.0s]: don't get any money from lifestyle
[8714.8s - 8719.1s]: interventions I don't get a commission
[8717.0s - 8721.6s]: for everybody who does a ketogenic diet
[8719.1s - 8724.1s]: in theory you'd have few to treat in
[8721.6s - 8726.6s]: theory you lose money because you have
[8724.1s - 8728.6s]: lose money by by getting people better
[8726.6s - 8733.4s]: and then they move on and don't need me
[8728.6s - 8735.7s]: anymore um I honestly believe that but I
[8733.4s - 8737.9s]: also believe there will be
[8735.7s - 8741.5s]: 20% maybe up to
[8737.9s - 8745.0s]: 40% who have severe disorders for whom
[8741.5s - 8747.1s]: those strategies just won't work and so
[8745.0s - 8750.7s]: I'm really interested in well what else
[8747.1s - 8753.3s]: could it be and this is just one of many
[8750.7s - 8757.7s]: examples of what else it could be they
[8753.3s - 8759.3s]: could have an autoimmune form of central
[8757.7s - 8761.6s]: B12
[8759.3s - 8764.1s]: deficiency and why does that matter
[8761.6s - 8766.7s]: because we can test for
[8764.1s - 8770.4s]: that and if if they have that we can
[8766.7s - 8773.4s]: treat it there's a clear unequivocal
[8770.4s - 8775.7s]: treatment and you know at the end of the
[8773.4s - 8776.8s]: day I think one of the biggest themes of
[8775.7s - 8780.4s]: my
[8776.8s - 8781.4s]: work is that right now in the mental
[8780.4s - 8784.5s]: health
[8781.4s - 8785.3s]: field we assign these diagnostic labels
[8784.5s - 8787.6s]: to
[8785.3s - 8789.2s]: people and for many of them they become
[8787.6s - 8791.8s]: life
[8789.2s - 8795.0s]: sentences you have
[8791.8s - 8797.0s]: schizophrenia that's a lifetime sentence
[8795.0s - 8798.4s]: it's probably never going to get better
[8797.0s - 8801.2s]: you certainly always have to take
[8798.4s - 8803.5s]: medicines for the rest of your life you
[8801.2s - 8807.0s]: have bipolar
[8803.5s - 8808.7s]: disorder it's for life you have chronic
[8807.0s - 8810.9s]: depression sorry we just don't know how
[8808.7s - 8812.4s]: to treat it depression should go away
[8810.9s - 8815.7s]: but it's not going away for you we don't
[8812.4s - 8817.8s]: know what to do sorry so
[8815.7s - 8819.7s]: sorry I know that you know on the
[8817.8s - 8823.5s]: surface it may sound like well those are
[8819.7s - 8826.6s]: just rare people Chris they're not rare
[8823.5s - 8831.1s]: people hundreds of millions of people on
[8826.6s - 8834.3s]: our planet are given these life
[8831.1s - 8836.8s]: sentences and we assume that we now know
[8834.3s - 8840.7s]: the cause the cause is you have
[8836.8s - 8843.4s]: schizophrenia that's the cause
[8840.7s - 8846.0s]: and in fact schizophrenia is
[8843.4s - 8849.0s]: only a label of
[8846.0s - 8851.4s]: symptoms schizophrenia means a person
[8849.0s - 8853.3s]: who has chronic psychotic symptoms of
[8851.4s - 8855.9s]: unknown
[8853.3s - 8858.9s]: ideology of unknown
[8855.9s - 8860.6s]: ideology because if we know the ideology
[8858.9s - 8862.6s]: you don't call them schizophrenic
[8860.6s - 8864.4s]: anymore you say they have vitamin B12
[8862.6s - 8866.8s]: deficiency and
[8864.4s - 8868.8s]: psychosis or you say they have an
[8866.8s - 8871.1s]: autoimmune disorder like lupus and
[8868.8s - 8873.9s]: psychosis
[8871.1s - 8875.4s]: and why is why is that so important
[8873.9s - 8877.4s]: because there's a treatment for these
[8875.4s - 8879.4s]: other things other than just antis
[8877.4s - 8882.6s]: psychotic
[8879.4s - 8885.2s]: medicin and what I really hope and
[8882.6s - 8888.9s]: implore our field will
[8885.2s - 8891.7s]: do is we will come into the 21st century
[8888.9s - 8895.0s]: and begin to recognize that there is a
[8891.7s - 8897.9s]: cause of schizophrenia there is a cause
[8895.0s - 8900.5s]: of bipolar symptoms there is a cause for
[8897.9s - 8903.6s]: chronic depression and that we will will
[8900.5s - 8906.6s]: begin to look for those causes and we
[8903.6s - 8909.4s]: will begin to treat those causes as
[8906.6s - 8912.0s]: opposed to just putting people on
[8909.4s - 8914.3s]: anticho or anti-depressants or mood
[8912.0s - 8916.5s]: stabilizers and telling them well we're
[8914.3s - 8918.7s]: really sorry we know these medicines
[8916.5s - 8921.3s]: don't cure your illness we know these
[8918.7s - 8923.7s]: are not disease modifying treatments
[8921.3s - 8925.7s]: we're really sorry we can't do better
[8923.7s - 8928.8s]: you're just going to have to suffer for
[8925.7s - 8931.4s]: life like we can do better and I applaud
[8928.8s - 8934.6s]: your efforts to bring about that change
[8931.4s - 8937.2s]: I mean I think people realizing that
[8934.6s - 8939.4s]: often not always but often mitochondrial
[8937.2s - 8941.7s]: dysfunction is at the heart of of these
[8939.4s - 8945.6s]: things um is
[8941.7s - 8947.5s]: critical um speaking of which I have to
[8945.6s - 8950.2s]: ask and feel free to pass on this
[8947.5s - 8952.7s]: question if if you like but um I become
[8950.2s - 8954.9s]: very interested in vaccine biology and
[8952.7s - 8957.9s]: the debate about vaccines about the
[8954.9s - 8959.8s]: adant that are used to deliver the
[8957.9s - 8962.1s]: vaccines there a um obviously there's a
[8959.8s - 8964.5s]: very contentious topic I just want to
[8962.1s - 8967.0s]: know without being I'm not trying to be
[8964.5s - 8969.4s]: Pro provocative here um is there any
[8967.0s - 8972.5s]: evidence that vaccines or the
[8969.4s - 8974.8s]: adant um for vaccines or anything about
[8972.5s - 8977.3s]: vaccines and their delivery can disrupt
[8974.8s - 8980.3s]: mitochondrial function you know so often
[8977.3s - 8982.0s]: we think that it's like the vaccine
[8980.3s - 8984.6s]: having a specific effect on what the
[8982.0s - 8986.2s]: vaccine was designed to Target that
[8984.6s - 8987.4s]: could potentially cause side effects or
[8986.2s - 8992.0s]: something like that that's what many of
[8987.4s - 8994.7s]: the theories hold but given um the key
[8992.0s - 8997.2s]: role of mitochondria in all aspects of
[8994.7s - 8998.1s]: brain functioning and given that some
[8997.2s - 9000.8s]: people
[8998.1s - 9002.5s]: are convinced I'm not saying I believe
[9000.8s - 9004.8s]: this but are convinced that vaccines are
[9002.5s - 9007.1s]: tied to these mental health challenges
[9004.8s - 9008.5s]: or to autism let's be direct about this
[9007.1s - 9011.0s]: is there is there any evidence that
[9008.5s - 9012.8s]: vaccines can of any kind can disrupt
[9011.0s - 9015.0s]: mitochondrial function or support
[9012.8s - 9016.8s]: mitochondrial function for that matter
[9015.0s - 9018.5s]: it is a
[9016.8s - 9020.8s]: contentious maybe it's a different
[9018.5s - 9021.9s]: episode no no no definitely I'm I'm
[9020.8s - 9023.3s]: definitely going to answer it but I'm
[9021.9s - 9025.4s]: going to give a long-winded answer if
[9023.3s - 9027.8s]: that's okay because I because I want I
[9025.4s - 9029.3s]: want to give credible information that's
[9027.8s - 9031.1s]: the only information we're interested in
[9029.3s - 9033.8s]: and I don't want to come down on one
[9031.1s - 9037.4s]: side that vaccines are 100% safe there's
[9033.8s - 9038.8s]: no question about it or yes vaccines
[9037.4s - 9040.6s]: cause autism and that's why we've got
[9038.8s - 9042.4s]: Sky recing Ras of autism because I don't
[9040.6s - 9046.7s]: think either of those extreme positions
[9042.4s - 9050.2s]: is true so I want to First back up and
[9046.7s - 9052.1s]: just ask a slightly different question
[9050.2s - 9055.4s]: is there any evidence that high levels
[9052.1s - 9057.4s]: of inflammation impair mitochondrial
[9055.4s - 9060.2s]: function the answer to that is
[9057.4s - 9062.8s]: unequivocally yes high levels of
[9060.2s - 9066.6s]: inflammation inflammatory cyto kindes
[9062.8s - 9069.4s]: like tnf Alpha inner Lucan six and
[9066.6s - 9072.4s]: others impair mitochondrial function we
[9069.4s - 9074.3s]: know that it is clear and
[9072.4s - 9077.0s]: unequivocal um and there are
[9074.3s - 9079.3s]: physiological reasons for it the the
[9077.0s - 9081.4s]: organism has to adapt so when you have
[9079.3s - 9084.8s]: the flu
[9081.4s - 9087.3s]: do you have Neuropsychiatric symptoms
[9084.8s - 9091.7s]: yes you do you're going to feel
[9087.3s - 9094.5s]: exhausted you're going to be less
[9091.7s - 9096.4s]: risk-taking you are not going to want to
[9094.5s - 9099.1s]: reproduce more than likely you're going
[9096.4s - 9102.9s]: to completely lose your libido
[9099.1s - 9104.7s]: completely lose it like zero
[9102.9s - 9106.2s]: interest and what are you going to want
[9104.7s - 9109.0s]: to do you're going to want to hide in
[9106.2s - 9112.8s]: bed and pull the covers over you and
[9109.0s - 9116.0s]: just retreat from the world for
[9112.8s - 9119.8s]: safety those are all effects on your
[9116.0s - 9122.7s]: mood your motivation rewarding behaviors
[9119.8s - 9125.4s]: all sorts of things the inflammation the
[9122.7s - 9126.8s]: infection is doing that to you and we
[9125.4s - 9129.0s]: know that it's inflammation because this
[9126.8s - 9131.6s]: happens with cancer it happens with
[9129.0s - 9133.5s]: treatments that cause inflammation if we
[9131.6s - 9134.3s]: give treatments that cause high levels
[9133.5s - 9136.6s]: of
[9134.3s - 9137.7s]: inflamation people experience these
[9136.6s - 9140.5s]: symptoms
[9137.7s - 9142.9s]: acutely if we give interfer on for
[9140.5s - 9143.9s]: example which can be a treatment for
[9142.9s - 9147.4s]: some
[9143.9s - 9149.5s]: disorders people will acutely develop
[9147.4s - 9152.4s]: all of these symptoms so we know that
[9149.5s - 9154.7s]: interferon
[9152.4s - 9156.7s]: itself will produce all of these
[9154.7s - 9160.1s]: Neuropsychiatric
[9156.7s - 9162.6s]: symptoms we also know from basic cell
[9160.1s - 9164.4s]: biology interferon interferes with
[9162.6s - 9165.7s]: mitochondrial function we know that it
[9164.4s - 9169.2s]: is
[9165.7s - 9171.8s]: unequivocal we now let's go to autism is
[9169.2s - 9174.2s]: there any evidence that
[9171.8s - 9176.1s]: inflammation can lead to
[9174.2s - 9179.6s]: autism we
[9176.1s - 9182.0s]: have Decades of evidence for
[9179.6s - 9186.2s]: this we know
[9182.0s - 9188.7s]: that over the course of the last
[9186.2s - 9192.4s]: century as there
[9188.7s - 9194.9s]: were kind of outbreaks of bacterial or
[9192.4s - 9198.0s]: viral infections in the
[9194.9s - 9200.3s]: population we saw higher rates of neuros
[9198.0s - 9202.9s]: psychiatric neurodevelopment mental
[9200.3s - 9205.6s]: disorders in The
[9202.9s - 9209.2s]: Offspring of the pregnant
[9205.6s - 9211.5s]: women so we've long known that and that
[9209.2s - 9213.4s]: evidence is pretty well established for
[9211.5s - 9216.6s]: instance uh forgive me but the one that
[9213.4s - 9220.2s]: I'm aware of is that flu in pregnant
[9216.6s - 9223.0s]: mothers at the first to second trimester
[9220.2s - 9225.0s]: transition is correlated with
[9223.0s - 9226.9s]: statistically higher incidents of
[9225.0s - 9229.5s]: schizophrenia in The Offspring do I have
[9226.9s - 9232.7s]: that right that's correct okay but then
[9229.5s - 9235.0s]: there there was a rubella outbreak that
[9232.7s - 9237.3s]: resulted in much higher rates of
[9235.0s - 9239.3s]: autism in The
[9237.3s - 9240.4s]: Offspring um that I think that was in
[9239.3s - 9245.6s]: the
[9240.4s - 9247.0s]: 1960s um and now we have really Decades
[9245.6s - 9249.4s]: of animal
[9247.0s - 9253.8s]: models so they take
[9249.4s - 9255.7s]: mice and they inject them with
[9253.8s - 9258.9s]: lipopolysaccharide which causes an
[9255.7s - 9260.9s]: inflammatory reaction and when they do
[9258.9s - 9265.6s]: this to pregnant
[9260.9s - 9269.1s]: mice the the the mice that are born to
[9265.6s - 9274.0s]: those women those those female
[9269.1s - 9276.4s]: mice are at much higher risk for showing
[9274.0s - 9280.6s]: signs or symptoms of what looks like a
[9276.4s - 9282.7s]: neurodevelopmental disorder um it's it's
[9280.6s - 9284.8s]: different diagnosing or whatever a
[9282.7s - 9289.2s]: neurodevelopmental condition in a
[9284.8s - 9294.1s]: mouse is it 100% no it's just we
[9289.2s - 9297.5s]: increase the risk so if you inject a
[9294.1s - 9299.8s]: pregnant Mouse with
[9297.5s - 9302.3s]: lipopolysaccharide can she can that
[9299.8s - 9305.9s]: Mouse still have a normal appearing
[9302.3s - 9307.9s]: Mouse yes but can't but the
[9305.9s - 9310.9s]: probability that The
[9307.9s - 9312.6s]: Offspring will have a
[9310.9s - 9314.9s]: neurodevelopmental symptoms of a
[9312.6s - 9317.2s]: neurodevelopmental condition increase
[9314.9s - 9320.3s]: that is where so much of the autism
[9317.2s - 9322.8s]: research has been focused is trying to
[9320.3s - 9325.6s]: understand this trying to understand
[9322.8s - 9328.0s]: what is happening with inflammation how
[9325.6s - 9330.2s]: does that impact
[9328.0s - 9332.8s]: neurodevelopment we know
[9330.2s - 9337.1s]: that so now back to the question that
[9332.8s - 9341.0s]: you posed is there any possibility that
[9337.1s - 9345.1s]: vaccines could contribute to that
[9341.0s - 9347.2s]: process do vaccines increase
[9345.1s - 9348.4s]: inflamation I think the answer to that
[9347.2s - 9351.3s]: is
[9348.4s - 9354.2s]: yes is is there variation in the
[9351.3s - 9358.1s]: inflammatory response between different
[9354.2s - 9363.6s]: people I think the answer to that is
[9358.1s - 9363.6s]: yes can some people have a hyper
[9364.0s - 9368.5s]: exaggerated inflammatory response in
[9366.9s - 9372.4s]: response to a
[9368.5s - 9376.8s]: vaccine I think the answer to that is
[9372.4s - 9379.7s]: yes in that condition so in that
[9376.8s - 9382.3s]: rare less common condition where
[9379.7s - 9385.9s]: somebody is having a hyper exaggerated
[9382.3s - 9390.1s]: inflammatory response to a
[9385.9s - 9390.1s]: vaccination could that impact
[9390.4s - 9394.6s]: neurodevelopment the science right now
[9393.0s - 9398.1s]: says
[9394.6s - 9400.9s]: yes we have no reason to think it
[9398.1s - 9406.6s]: wouldn't there's one
[9400.9s - 9410.2s]: case of a young child who already had an
[9406.6s - 9414.0s]: existing mitochondrial disorder
[9410.2s - 9416.4s]: it was already known she got
[9414.0s - 9419.0s]: vaccines and I think within days or
[9416.4s - 9421.4s]: weeks of getting the vaccinations she
[9419.0s - 9424.4s]: developed profound
[9421.4s - 9424.4s]: neurodevelopmental
[9424.6s - 9432.4s]: symptoms that case won a
[9429.4s - 9436.8s]: lawsuit that went to court it was tried
[9432.4s - 9440.1s]: in court and she won and the Court ruled
[9436.8s - 9443.6s]: that the vaccine did in fact contribute
[9440.1s - 9445.8s]: to this girl's neurodevelopmental
[9443.6s - 9447.2s]: condition now they assumed it was
[9445.8s - 9448.8s]: because she had a pre-existing
[9447.2s - 9451.9s]: mitochondrial
[9448.8s - 9454.6s]: disorder um and I would support that it
[9451.9s - 9458.2s]: lines up perfectly with what I've been
[9454.6s - 9460.5s]: talking about all along um that people
[9458.2s - 9462.1s]: who have vulnerabilities with
[9460.5s - 9465.2s]: mitochondria or
[9462.1s - 9468.4s]: metabolism you can only absorb so many
[9465.2s - 9471.2s]: hits and when you get that final hit
[9468.4s - 9473.8s]: that tips kind of the
[9471.2s - 9475.2s]: balance um to impact neurod development
[9473.8s - 9479.5s]: you can get
[9475.2s - 9481.5s]: that when now coming back to the bigger
[9479.5s - 9482.5s]: question so should people get vaccinated
[9481.5s - 9487.4s]: or
[9482.5s - 9491.7s]: not we do have reasonably good
[9487.4s - 9495.6s]: evidence that unvaccinated people are
[9491.7s - 9498.1s]: more likely to develop autism than
[9495.6s - 9501.0s]: vaccinated people is that right the
[9498.1s - 9503.4s]: problem with that study is that it's an
[9501.0s - 9507.1s]: it's a
[9503.4s - 9511.0s]: retrospective cohort epidemiological
[9507.1s - 9513.1s]: study and the biggest critique that I
[9511.0s - 9515.2s]: have of that type of research is that
[9513.1s - 9517.7s]: the researchers decide what they control
[9515.2s - 9521.0s]: for and what they don't control
[9517.7s - 9524.4s]: for but the existing research right now
[9521.0s - 9527.5s]: as published and as
[9524.4s - 9530.2s]: designed suggests
[9527.5s - 9532.0s]: that if you don't get a vaccine you're
[9530.2s - 9535.0s]: more likely to develop autism than if
[9532.0s - 9537.4s]: you do get a vaccine and how would I
[9535.0s - 9539.6s]: understand that I just talked about
[9537.4s - 9541.2s]: infections themselves can cause
[9539.6s - 9545.4s]: neurodevelopmental
[9541.2s - 9547.5s]: disorders so if a child gets
[9545.4s - 9550.3s]: measles they're not only at risk of
[9547.5s - 9552.2s]: dying of measles they're also at risk of
[9550.3s - 9553.8s]: impacting their mitochondrial function
[9552.2s - 9556.2s]: and developing a neurodevelopmental
[9553.8s - 9558.3s]: disorder as a result of getting a severe
[9556.2s - 9560.0s]: infection assuming there's choice
[9558.3s - 9563.9s]: there's a risk benefit in analysis do
[9560.0s - 9566.0s]: you do you want the the uh the potential
[9563.9s - 9568.3s]: inflammation from the vaccine or lack of
[9566.0s - 9569.6s]: infl you run the gamble it's hard to
[9568.3s - 9571.9s]: predict who's going to have a big
[9569.6s - 9573.9s]: inflammatory response and who's not
[9571.9s - 9575.7s]: although I'm thinking in the back of my
[9573.9s - 9578.4s]: mind about these lifestyle factors even
[9575.7s - 9580.5s]: though it's a young child or a or um an
[9578.4s - 9582.5s]: adolescent in some cases but but young
[9580.5s - 9586.3s]: children typically there are things that
[9582.5s - 9588.6s]: you can do to bolster the the uh the
[9586.3s - 9590.0s]: health of that kid going into a vaccine
[9588.6s - 9591.6s]: if you're choosing to vaccinate your
[9590.0s - 9593.7s]: kids right like proper sleep proper
[9591.6s - 9595.6s]: nutrition proper proper everything you
[9593.7s - 9598.1s]: wouldn't want them even slightly sleep
[9595.6s - 9599.8s]: deprived because that would uh increase
[9598.1s - 9602.8s]: the risk of inflammation right I mean
[9599.8s - 9604.2s]: these things compound as I understand it
[9602.8s - 9607.2s]: um
[9604.2s - 9608.8s]: so you know I think what most all
[9607.2s - 9611.6s]: parents really want is a sense of
[9608.8s - 9613.4s]: control over what are inevitably a
[9611.6s - 9615.4s]: mixture of controllable and
[9613.4s - 9617.7s]: uncontrollable factors and this is what
[9615.4s - 9621.0s]: I hear when I really listen to this
[9617.7s - 9623.8s]: debate about vaccines I hear my science
[9621.0s - 9626.9s]: colleagues inevitably saying okay the
[9623.8s - 9628.8s]: Wake field data or BS Etc like no no no
[9626.9s - 9631.6s]: there's no possibility and then I hear
[9628.8s - 9635.2s]: parents who are having kids whose kids
[9631.6s - 9636.7s]: are due for vaccines and they're like I
[9635.2s - 9639.6s]: don't know what to do they're they're
[9636.7s - 9641.2s]: terrified and these are smart people and
[9639.6s - 9643.0s]: they don't know what to believe anymore
[9641.2s - 9646.7s]: that's the challenge I mean the science
[9643.0s - 9650.2s]: that I just laid out is true it's
[9646.7s - 9653.0s]: clear um and again we've got Decades of
[9650.2s - 9656.2s]: research to support most of what I've
[9653.0s - 9658.8s]: just said all of what I've just said I
[9656.2s - 9663.2s]: think
[9658.8s - 9663.2s]: um if you understand the
[9664.8s - 9671.5s]: biology when a child begins to show
[9668.2s - 9674.9s]: symptoms of a neurodevelopmental
[9671.5s - 9676.2s]: disorder instead of assigning a label
[9674.9s - 9680.2s]: this is
[9676.2s - 9682.4s]: autism it's a life sentence
[9680.2s - 9682.4s]: good
[9683.0s - 9688.0s]: luck we should be
[9685.4s - 9690.6s]: intervening and what could we do to
[9688.0s - 9694.2s]: intervene what you just said in terms of
[9690.6s - 9696.4s]: prevention strategies absolutely let's
[9694.2s - 9698.4s]: make sure that even before you're going
[9696.4s - 9701.2s]: to the doctor even before you're
[9698.4s - 9703.7s]: exposing yourself to any of these
[9701.2s - 9705.5s]: vaccines that you're healthy why because
[9703.7s - 9708.2s]: we want you to be healthy why wouldn't
[9705.5s - 9711.2s]: you want to be healthy so let's just be
[9708.2s - 9714.2s]: healthy but I would actually go much
[9711.2s - 9716.9s]: further and say as soon as a child
[9714.2s - 9719.3s]: begins to show signs or symptoms
[9716.9s - 9722.2s]: especially when it's an Abrupt
[9719.3s - 9724.6s]: change when they were developing in a
[9722.2s - 9727.0s]: neurotypical way and then all of a
[9724.6s - 9730.1s]: sudden they got an infection or they got
[9727.0s - 9732.8s]: a vaccine or something happened and now
[9730.1s - 9735.4s]: they are falling off the
[9732.8s - 9737.5s]: trajectory and that's what we hear from
[9735.4s - 9740.0s]: these parents who are saying No this is
[9737.5s - 9743.4s]: real this is that's why they believe
[9740.0s - 9746.9s]: vaccines cause it do I think it was just
[9743.4s - 9749.0s]: the vaccine on its own I suspect a lot
[9746.9s - 9751.4s]: of them have had other hits they
[9749.0s - 9753.3s]: probably had other vulnerabilities going
[9751.4s - 9755.4s]: into that
[9753.3s - 9758.4s]: vaccination and that the
[9755.4s - 9760.6s]: vaccination if we even entertain the
[9758.4s - 9762.0s]: possibility that That vaccine did
[9760.6s - 9765.4s]: contribute to their
[9762.0s - 9768.1s]: autism I'm doubtful that it was the sole
[9765.4s - 9769.9s]: only cause I'm doubtful it was the sole
[9768.1s - 9772.1s]: cause but
[9769.9s - 9774.1s]: regardless once the kid starts showing
[9772.1s - 9776.2s]: signs or
[9774.1s - 9778.6s]: symptoms we should be doing a full
[9776.2s - 9780.5s]: workup we should be looking for vitamin
[9778.6s - 9782.8s]: and nutrient deficiencies we should be
[9780.5s - 9785.4s]: looking for this Central B12 deficiency
[9782.8s - 9788.9s]: did the vaccine somehow cause an
[9785.4s - 9791.7s]: autoimmune reaction to cd320 so that now
[9788.9s - 9794.5s]: this kid has Central B12 deficiency and
[9791.7s - 9796.3s]: that is why this kid is falling off the
[9794.5s - 9799.8s]: chart
[9796.3s - 9803.6s]: um should we entertain a ketogen diet
[9799.8s - 9806.7s]: for this child I would say yes we should
[9803.6s - 9809.6s]: that should be on the table of options
[9806.7s - 9811.8s]: um we might want to put this child on a
[9809.6s - 9813.3s]: ketogenic diet does that ever happen it
[9811.8s - 9816.2s]: happens all the time in kids with
[9813.3s - 9818.8s]: epilepsy so why not do it for
[9816.2s - 9821.0s]: neurodevelopmental conditions but again
[9818.8s - 9822.7s]: it's not just keto diet is going to save
[9821.0s - 9824.7s]: the day and we don't have to think about
[9822.7s - 9826.7s]: Central B12 deficiency or any of these
[9824.7s - 9830.1s]: other things like let's put it all
[9826.7s - 9833.1s]: together and especially with AI now now
[9830.1s - 9836.2s]: we can do this this is a solvable puzzle
[9833.1s - 9838.7s]: it is a complex puzzle no doubt but it
[9836.2s - 9841.6s]: is a solvable puzzle and we should start
[9838.7s - 9845.3s]: to solve it but right now the state of
[9841.6s - 9848.3s]: the field is that we assign a label
[9845.3s - 9850.2s]: autism and we tell the parents to just
[9848.3s - 9854.2s]: prepare for a
[9850.2s - 9857.0s]: disabled child just prepare yourself to
[9854.2s - 9859.2s]: take care of a disabled child for life
[9857.0s - 9861.8s]: we're really sorry we don't have
[9859.2s - 9864.4s]: anything more to offer we can do some
[9861.8s - 9866.6s]: ABA training we can do some basic you
[9864.4s - 9869.9s]: know we'll try to teach them some social
[9866.6s - 9873.2s]: skills the the the real outcome data on
[9869.9s - 9876.0s]: that is pretty
[9873.2s - 9879.5s]: bad if if your brain's not working right
[9876.0s - 9881.6s]: it's hard to teach people how to have
[9879.5s - 9884.9s]: how to do the skills that the brain is
[9881.6s - 9888.3s]: designed to do and that's the challenge
[9884.9s - 9890.4s]: is that um it's all well and good to
[9888.3s - 9892.0s]: recognize a problem but now we need to
[9890.4s - 9895.4s]: come up with effective treatments and we
[9892.0s - 9896.9s]: know that a lot of the you know people
[9895.4s - 9899.2s]: talk about early intervention with
[9896.9s - 9901.7s]: autism as though early intervention is
[9899.2s - 9904.5s]: going to save the
[9901.7s - 9905.7s]: day I don't mean to bash the people
[9904.5s - 9909.4s]: doing that
[9905.7s - 9912.8s]: work let's do anything we
[9909.4s - 9914.4s]: can it might help a little but when you
[9912.8s - 9916.6s]: look at the outcome data it's not
[9914.4s - 9918.7s]: helping much and when you look at the
[9916.6s - 9921.2s]: statistics of the prevalence of autism
[9918.7s - 9922.9s]: it's going through the roof so those
[9921.2s - 9924.9s]: strategies are just not working they're
[9922.9s - 9926.8s]: not working for prevention they're not
[9924.9s - 9929.4s]: working to improve long-term outcomes
[9926.8s - 9932.1s]: they're not I mean we have a lot of work
[9929.4s - 9936.4s]: to do so I appreciate the thoroughness
[9932.1s - 9938.0s]: of your answer I can um promise you that
[9936.4s - 9940.3s]: uh anything we put out about that will
[9938.0s - 9942.4s]: include the full context we're not we're
[9940.3s - 9943.8s]: not people will take the sound bite and
[9942.4s - 9947.4s]: well if they do I'm going to get I'm
[9943.8s - 9949.2s]: going to um get rabid um by posting the
[9947.4s - 9951.6s]: Preamble because it's very important
[9949.2s - 9954.1s]: people hear the full context it's um and
[9951.6s - 9956.4s]: I I really appreciate you uh embracing
[9954.1s - 9960.7s]: that topic with the the depth and rigor
[9956.4s - 9961.4s]: and uh sensitivity also that that you do
[9960.7s - 9964.4s]: uh
[9961.4s - 9968.9s]: because I don't think we can um duck
[9964.4s - 9970.9s]: this vaccine question anymore um I never
[9968.9s - 9972.2s]: thought in my lifetime that vaccines
[9970.9s - 9974.6s]: would be a thing it's like when I was a
[9972.2s - 9976.2s]: kid everyone got the polio vaccine the
[9974.6s - 9977.8s]: measles vaccine and he kind of went
[9976.2s - 9979.8s]: about our way I do understand the number
[9977.8s - 9982.8s]: of vaccines that kids are getting now
[9979.8s - 9987.4s]: like the vaccine schedule has expanded
[9982.8s - 9988.8s]: um uh yeah I've been um kind of thrown
[9987.4s - 9990.4s]: into the middle of this as different
[9988.8s - 9992.4s]: guests have come on this podcast who've
[9990.4s - 9994.9s]: said they do get the flu vaccine others
[9992.4s - 9996.9s]: who say they don't and you know gosh if
[9994.9s - 9998.7s]: ever there was a separator besides
[9996.9s - 10001.5s]: Democrat versus Republican it's this
[9998.7s - 10004.6s]: vaccine thing um it's really like the
[10001.5s - 10007.4s]: separator uh is it's it's so closely
[10004.6s - 10008.6s]: tied to um believes in science doesn't
[10007.4s - 10011.8s]: believe in science like that's those are
[10008.6s - 10015.0s]: the stereotypes right or um suspicious
[10011.8s - 10017.6s]: of science NIH and CDC or believes in
[10015.0s - 10020.6s]: science NIH and the CDC wholeheartedly
[10017.6s - 10022.9s]: like the The Divide is very Stark and
[10020.6s - 10024.6s]: this needs to stop like the Divide needs
[10022.9s - 10027.9s]: to stop we we need to start filling in
[10024.6s - 10031.2s]: with answers um and I think there's soon
[10027.9s - 10032.7s]: to be a exploration uh a scientific
[10031.2s - 10034.1s]: exploration of the relationship between
[10032.7s - 10036.3s]: vaccines and autism I read this
[10034.1s - 10038.3s]: someplace on X which
[10036.3s - 10040.0s]: means but I think that's the idea and I
[10038.3s - 10041.8s]: think some people kind of upset that
[10040.0s - 10043.0s]: this that resources were going to be
[10041.8s - 10044.7s]: devoted to this because they felt like
[10043.0s - 10046.0s]: it was it was a done deal and then
[10044.7s - 10048.6s]: others are very excited because they
[10046.0s - 10050.6s]: feel like Hey listen if if you don't
[10048.6s - 10053.2s]: think there's a a link then there here's
[10050.6s - 10055.4s]: an opportunity to to establish that with
[10053.2s - 10057.0s]: with real rigor and I think everyone's
[10055.4s - 10059.5s]: just really interested in the the stud
[10057.0s - 10062.5s]: being done properly I look I think more
[10059.5s - 10064.3s]: data is always great I don't disagree i'
[10062.5s - 10067.2s]: and I've I've actually talked to some
[10064.3s - 10072.2s]: former nmh directors about this and some
[10067.2s - 10074.5s]: other leading people in this field and
[10072.2s - 10077.1s]: there's no doubt that this topic has
[10074.5s - 10080.8s]: been brought up multiple times at the
[10077.1s - 10082.1s]: NIH so there's this inter agency um
[10080.8s - 10084.5s]: Coordinating
[10082.1s - 10089.0s]: Committee um on
[10084.5s - 10092.0s]: autism uh within among all of the NIH
[10089.0s - 10095.7s]: kind of centers and institutes that's
[10092.0s - 10098.8s]: existed for decades they have looked
[10095.7s - 10101.4s]: into this issue um I've talked to some
[10098.8s - 10103.9s]: autism Advocates who've said like I was
[10101.4s - 10107.0s]: hoping that vaccines
[10103.9s - 10108.5s]: might be the cause like I was really
[10107.0s - 10110.9s]: hoping to see that vaccines are the
[10108.5s - 10115.1s]: cause because that would then give us a
[10110.9s - 10117.6s]: cause and it would lead us to
[10115.1s - 10120.9s]: interventions um to make vaccine safer
[10117.6s - 10123.0s]: or whatever um and she said but it's
[10120.9s - 10125.8s]: just not there it's just not there and
[10123.0s - 10128.5s]: this former NIMH director that I spoke
[10125.8s - 10129.6s]: with it's just not there Chris it's not
[10128.5s - 10134.2s]: there
[10129.6s - 10139.2s]: um we looked we looked high and low um
[10134.2s - 10142.0s]: again I'm not sure that everybody looked
[10139.2s - 10145.1s]: with the same degree of scrutiny again
[10142.0s - 10148.2s]: the study that I saw looked at people
[10145.1s - 10152.5s]: who are unvaccinated by choice so these
[10148.2s - 10153.7s]: are rebellious people who are defying
[10152.5s - 10157.6s]: state
[10153.7s - 10159.8s]: laws who are risking not getting their
[10157.6s - 10161.9s]: children into school because they're not
[10159.8s - 10164.2s]: getting
[10161.9s - 10167.8s]: vaccinations that's the cohort of
[10164.2s - 10169.5s]: unvaccinated people um and then they're
[10167.8s - 10172.0s]: comparing them to the cohort of
[10169.5s - 10176.8s]: vaccinated people and they only
[10172.0s - 10180.3s]: controlled for like a like two or three
[10176.8s - 10183.5s]: variables they did not control for
[10180.3s - 10185.2s]: obesity they didn't control for diabetes
[10183.5s - 10187.2s]: and we know that obesity and diabetes
[10185.2s - 10190.7s]: play a role in risk for
[10187.2s - 10194.0s]: autism and we know know that people who
[10190.7s - 10197.0s]: have existing health conditions might
[10194.0s - 10200.7s]: actually be more likely to be worried
[10197.0s - 10203.4s]: about vaccines and then not get vaccines
[10200.7s - 10206.1s]: perfectly happy healthy thriving people
[10203.4s - 10209.0s]: usually just go along with status quo
[10206.1s - 10210.7s]: they usually don't refuse vaccines so
[10209.0s - 10213.1s]: people who are refusing vaccines
[10210.7s - 10216.0s]: probably had some pre-existing health
[10213.1s - 10217.8s]: condition they didn't control for that
[10216.0s - 10220.4s]: did that pre-existing health condition
[10217.8s - 10223.4s]: increase risk for or
[10220.4s - 10225.9s]: Autism probably well if there's an
[10223.4s - 10227.7s]: inflammation link then yes like like
[10225.9s - 10229.3s]: probably I mean you look at any
[10227.7s - 10231.1s]: pre-existing health condition and does
[10229.3s - 10234.0s]: it increase risk for other health
[10231.1s - 10236.2s]: conditions usually the answer is yes so
[10234.0s - 10239.1s]: we know that like women with obesity
[10236.2s - 10241.9s]: much more likely twice as likely to have
[10239.1s - 10244.6s]: an autistic child is that right yeah
[10241.9s - 10246.8s]: meta analysis over three million people
[10244.6s - 10250.2s]: women with obesity have doubled the risk
[10246.8s - 10252.1s]: of having an autistic child
[10250.2s - 10255.2s]: have rates of obesity been skyrocketing
[10252.1s - 10257.4s]: in our population the answer is yes are
[10255.2s - 10260.4s]: pregnant women also in that camp of
[10257.4s - 10261.9s]: obese women yes well that accounts for a
[10260.4s - 10267.8s]: doubling of
[10261.9s - 10269.1s]: autism same deal with um diabetes women
[10267.8s - 10271.8s]: who have
[10269.1s - 10273.7s]: diabetes twice as likely to have
[10271.8s - 10274.5s]: autistic children is women who don't
[10273.7s - 10277.2s]: have
[10274.5s - 10279.4s]: diabetes when you put the two together
[10277.2s - 10282.7s]: obese and diabetic
[10279.4s - 10285.2s]: quadruple the rate of autism in The
[10282.7s - 10286.7s]: Offspring what about dad you know there
[10285.2s - 10289.0s]: are these theories about the
[10286.7s - 10292.7s]: statistically significant increases in
[10289.0s - 10296.8s]: rates of autism for offspring of um men
[10292.7s - 10299.3s]: who are 50 or older my read of the data
[10296.8s - 10300.8s]: uh is that it's still a very small
[10299.3s - 10303.0s]: increase it's not like the kind of
[10300.8s - 10306.8s]: increases you're describing here for
[10303.0s - 10309.8s]: diabetes it is so men with obesity twice
[10306.8s - 10311.5s]: as likely to have an autistic child as
[10309.8s - 10315.4s]: men who are not obese yeah which is
[10311.5s - 10318.8s]: which is um something like 25 times
[10315.4s - 10320.9s]: greater than the increase due to age of
[10318.8s - 10323.7s]: the male so this is so important because
[10320.9s - 10325.9s]: people hear oh you know uh older sperm
[10323.7s - 10328.0s]: equals higher probability of autism but
[10325.9s - 10330.9s]: yes still a very low probability of
[10328.0s - 10335.6s]: autism compared to Dad is obese but in
[10330.9s - 10337.5s]: his 20s or 30s yes and so you know a lot
[10335.6s - 10339.3s]: of people are hyperfocused on vaccines
[10337.5s - 10341.4s]: cause autism
[10339.3s - 10343.5s]: and they come back to rates of autism
[10341.4s - 10346.3s]: are skyrocketing there has to be a
[10343.5s - 10348.3s]: reason well I agree rates of autism are
[10346.3s - 10349.1s]: skyrocketing I agree there does have to
[10348.3s - 10351.3s]: be a
[10349.1s - 10355.3s]: reason maybe we're missing the elephant
[10351.3s - 10357.4s]: in the room rates of metabolic poor
[10355.3s - 10359.7s]: health are skyrocketing in our
[10357.4s - 10362.1s]: population rates of obesity and diabetes
[10359.7s - 10365.1s]: are skyrocketing but rates of poor
[10362.1s - 10366.5s]: metabolic health so metabolic syndrome
[10365.1s - 10369.3s]: has five
[10366.5s - 10371.6s]: biomarkers you know abdominal obesity
[10369.3s - 10375.6s]: blood pressure
[10371.6s - 10379.2s]: um uh glucose high levels of glucose and
[10375.6s - 10380.8s]: then high triglycerides and low HDL
[10379.2s - 10383.6s]: cholesterol those are the five
[10380.8s - 10387.6s]: biomarkers of metabolic
[10383.6s - 10390.8s]: syndrome only 7% of
[10387.6s - 10395.6s]: Americans are healthy in all five
[10390.8s - 10395.6s]: biomarkers yikes only
[10397.2s - 10403.6s]: 7% po or metabolic Health influences
[10401.6s - 10407.4s]: neurodevelopment and
[10403.6s - 10409.5s]: Offspring we know that so we've we see
[10407.4s - 10411.5s]: skyrocketing rates of autism it's not
[10409.5s - 10414.1s]: just autism we see skyrocketing rates of
[10411.5s - 10415.8s]: ADHD as well
[10414.1s - 10417.2s]: simultaneously and everybody's
[10415.8s - 10419.4s]: scratching their heads trying to figure
[10417.2s - 10422.3s]: out where's all this autism coming from
[10419.4s - 10425.4s]: where's all this ADHD coming from well
[10422.3s - 10427.9s]: look around people as the metabolic
[10425.4s - 10429.5s]: health of the United States population
[10427.9s - 10432.4s]: declin
[10429.5s - 10435.4s]: we are going to see more
[10432.4s - 10438.6s]: neurodevelopmental disorders such it's a
[10435.4s - 10441.7s]: critical message but also reassuring in
[10438.6s - 10443.7s]: the sense that we can do something about
[10441.7s - 10446.7s]: it we can because what you're talking
[10443.7s - 10450.2s]: about is metabolic dysfunction
[10446.7s - 10454.5s]: mitochondrial dysfunction of the parents
[10450.2s - 10457.5s]: right um so you know trying to control
[10454.5s - 10459.6s]: the uh the behavior of still unborn um
[10457.5s - 10463.5s]: or yet to be see children is pretty
[10459.6s - 10467.1s]: tough to do and um and yet anyone
[10463.5s - 10468.7s]: thinking of conceiving um should really
[10467.1s - 10470.8s]: pay close attention to their metabolic
[10468.7s - 10473.7s]: health is clearly the message I think
[10470.8s - 10478.4s]: obesity becomes a little bit of a
[10473.7s - 10480.5s]: um of a of a critical Factor yet a
[10478.4s - 10482.0s]: distractor that wasn't meant to rhyme uh
[10480.5s - 10483.6s]: for when we hear metabolic health I
[10482.0s - 10486.3s]: think a number of people hearing this
[10483.6s - 10488.7s]: will say well I'm not overweight so my
[10486.3s - 10491.6s]: mitochondria are probably healthy but
[10488.7s - 10494.6s]: what you listed off included high high
[10491.6s - 10496.5s]: triglycerides um you said blood pressure
[10494.6s - 10500.5s]: which you know there are some thin
[10496.5s - 10502.5s]: people or you know non apparently obese
[10500.5s - 10503.6s]: people it's I say apparently obese
[10502.5s - 10505.1s]: because a lot of people are carrying
[10503.6s - 10506.8s]: higher body fat percentage than they
[10505.1s - 10509.5s]: realize even though they're they're not
[10506.8s - 10513.3s]: you know taking up a lot of space um so
[10509.5s - 10516.6s]: I think you know uh it's not always and
[10513.3s - 10518.7s]: low HDL so sometimes um you know we're
[10516.6s - 10521.1s]: shocked to see like oh this person is
[10518.7s - 10523.6s]: like apparently healthy but has you know
[10521.1s - 10526.0s]: low HDL and is got their apob is through
[10523.6s - 10528.7s]: the roof and they're they're not well
[10526.0s - 10529.9s]: but just because they're not obese
[10528.7s - 10532.5s]: doesn't mean they're metabolically
[10529.9s - 10535.2s]: healthy correct that is absolutely
[10532.5s - 10537.1s]: correct and I go back to some of our
[10535.2s - 10540.4s]: prior conversation
[10537.1s - 10543.6s]: so a 14-year-old girl
[10540.4s - 10546.2s]: who is severely iron
[10543.6s - 10549.0s]: deficient is metabolically
[10546.2s - 10552.2s]: unhealthy why because our mitochondria
[10549.0s - 10552.9s]: can't function properly without iron she
[10552.2s - 10554.2s]: can be
[10552.9s - 10558.2s]: [Music]
[10554.2s - 10559.4s]: thin she can otherwise look like a
[10558.2s - 10561.0s]: healthy
[10559.4s - 10564.3s]: attractive
[10561.0s - 10566.6s]: girl but she can be metabolically
[10564.3s - 10568.6s]: unhealthy because she doesn't have all
[10566.6s - 10571.5s]: of the essential vitamins and nutrients
[10568.6s - 10573.8s]: that she needs to have properly
[10571.5s - 10577.5s]: functioning mitochondria and
[10573.8s - 10580.1s]: metabolism and why would that matter it
[10577.5s - 10582.9s]: matters because she might develop an
[10580.1s - 10585.6s]: anxiety disorder or she might develop
[10582.9s - 10587.0s]: depression or she might develop symptoms
[10585.6s - 10589.1s]: of an eating
[10587.0s - 10591.0s]: disorder and then we're all scratching
[10589.1s - 10592.9s]: our heads giving those labels oh you've
[10591.0s - 10597.2s]: got depression you've got anxiety you
[10592.9s - 10600.2s]: need Prozac and maybe she really needs
[10597.2s - 10602.4s]: iron right I mean what I realized and
[10600.2s - 10607.0s]: and this was really where I wanted to
[10602.4s - 10609.5s]: bring us to um is a question for you I
[10607.0s - 10611.2s]: have an idea but a let also posed the
[10609.5s - 10613.7s]: question as an idea and feel free to bat
[10611.2s - 10615.8s]: it down I'm beginning to think that in
[10613.7s - 10618.2s]: order to get out of this health rut that
[10615.8s - 10619.7s]: we're in that clearly relates to
[10618.2s - 10621.7s]: mitochondrial
[10619.7s - 10624.4s]: dysfunction and at the same time there
[10621.7s - 10625.9s]: are tools the lifestyle tools that you
[10624.4s - 10627.7s]: described there are yes there are
[10625.9s - 10631.2s]: supplements and maybe methylene blue
[10627.7s - 10633.1s]: will be advantageous and methyl B12
[10631.2s - 10636.4s]: perhaps but certainly the lifestyle
[10633.1s - 10638.2s]: factors most people again when they hear
[10636.4s - 10640.8s]: metabolic Health they just think okay
[10638.2s - 10642.7s]: metabolism obesity thinness or fatness
[10640.8s - 10645.2s]: and and they it sort of becomes a a
[10642.7s - 10648.3s]: gravitational pull towards that do you
[10645.2s - 10650.0s]: think it's possible to create a metric I
[10648.3s - 10651.4s]: don't want to say BMI as an example
[10650.0s - 10654.5s]: because that's controversial for some
[10651.4s - 10657.7s]: people but is it possible to create a
[10654.5s - 10660.1s]: metric of allaround metabolic Health um
[10657.7s - 10661.5s]: that would be incentivized so that
[10660.1s - 10663.7s]: people can live better lives their
[10661.5s - 10665.9s]: offspring can be healthier as well and
[10663.7s - 10668.4s]: we can unburden the Health Care system
[10665.9s - 10669.6s]: and and potentially avoid Millions and
[10668.4s - 10672.0s]: millions of people having these
[10669.6s - 10673.9s]: so-called incurable mental health
[10672.0s - 10676.0s]: disorders in air
[10673.9s - 10678.4s]: quotes you know what you're describing
[10676.0s - 10684.0s]: is kind of in my
[10678.4s - 10686.3s]: mind um a really important next step and
[10684.0s - 10688.6s]: the great news is that there are several
[10686.3s - 10691.4s]: research groups that I know of that are
[10688.6s - 10693.6s]: working on exactly that one is a
[10691.4s - 10695.3s]: commercial company I'm not going to name
[10693.6s - 10698.3s]: any names but one is a commercial
[10695.3s - 10701.2s]: company that has a
[10698.3s - 10703.4s]: a a product of a series of biomarkers
[10701.2s - 10705.5s]: blood biomarkers that they
[10703.4s - 10707.9s]: believe represent ultimately
[10705.5s - 10709.7s]: mitochondrial dysfunction all of the
[10707.9s - 10712.1s]: different cellular Pathways that can
[10709.7s - 10714.4s]: result in mitochondrial dysfunction and
[10712.1s - 10717.2s]: or can reflect mitochondrial
[10714.4s - 10718.3s]: dysfunction and um and they believe that
[10717.2s - 10720.8s]: their
[10718.3s - 10722.0s]: test might be able to predict the
[10720.8s - 10724.6s]: development of
[10722.0s - 10727.3s]: autism that every child at age one
[10724.6s - 10729.4s]: should get this blood biomarker and it
[10727.3s - 10731.5s]: will tell us who's at high risk of
[10729.4s - 10734.2s]: developing a neurodevelopmental
[10731.5s - 10735.6s]: disorder the test itself doesn't tell us
[10734.2s - 10738.1s]: what's wrong it just tells us
[10735.6s - 10739.9s]: something's wrong and then the
[10738.1s - 10742.0s]: clinicians need to go to work and try to
[10739.9s - 10745.5s]: figure out what is going on what is
[10742.0s - 10747.5s]: causing this metabolic mitochondrial
[10745.5s - 10749.6s]: disregulation so that we could
[10747.5s - 10751.3s]: potentially intervene I've talked with
[10749.6s - 10753.8s]: one of the leading mitochondrial
[10751.3s - 10755.7s]: researchers really in the world he's got
[10753.8s - 10758.5s]: a set of 20
[10755.7s - 10760.9s]: biomarkers that he believes represent
[10758.5s - 10763.7s]: mitochondrial dysfunction broadly and
[10760.9s - 10766.9s]: then there's another research group um
[10763.7s - 10770.2s]: that is is actually narrowed it down to
[10766.9s - 10772.9s]: just five different biomarkers in men
[10770.2s - 10776.5s]: and five slightly different there's some
[10772.9s - 10779.5s]: overlap but slight differences in women
[10776.5s - 10782.3s]: and those five biomarkers alone were
[10779.5s - 10784.7s]: able to distinguish people with chronic
[10782.3s - 10788.1s]: severe suicidal depression from healthy
[10784.7s - 10791.6s]: controls with over 90% sensitivity in
[10788.1s - 10793.6s]: specificity wow so I think that is one
[10791.6s - 10797.6s]: of the directions we need to go is we
[10793.6s - 10799.8s]: need to establish tests with all of
[10797.6s - 10801.1s]: these groups I want to just state state
[10799.8s - 10802.9s]: clearly and plainly because one of the
[10801.1s - 10804.4s]: common questions I get is what's the
[10802.9s - 10807.4s]: blood test I can get for my
[10804.4s - 10810.5s]: mitochondrial Health there isn't one um
[10807.4s - 10814.0s]: that's the answer there is not one there
[10810.5s - 10816.8s]: are lots of different biomarkers that
[10814.0s - 10818.7s]: can suggest disregulation of metabolism
[10816.8s - 10820.4s]: and mitochondrial function
[10818.7s - 10822.6s]: um and again these three research groups
[10820.4s - 10824.9s]: are all working on it you know in order
[10822.6s - 10826.8s]: to get those five biomarkers for men and
[10824.9s - 10827.7s]: women they I think they measured 400
[10826.8s - 10830.0s]: different
[10827.7s - 10832.5s]: biomarkers um so we need to make sure
[10830.0s - 10834.6s]: that that gets replicated that it's you
[10832.5s - 10836.8s]: know prospectively it can identify
[10834.6s - 10841.2s]: people
[10836.8s - 10843.0s]: um I'm I'm less concerned about kind of
[10841.2s - 10845.3s]: the incentivizing and let's give
[10843.0s - 10847.3s]: insurance discounts and other things I
[10845.3s - 10850.0s]: actually think the majority of human
[10847.3s - 10850.9s]: beings that I know authentically want to
[10850.0s - 10853.6s]: be
[10850.9s - 10856.1s]: healthy and they authentically they
[10853.6s - 10858.4s]: really want to have healthy
[10856.1s - 10859.5s]: children they will do anything to have
[10858.4s - 10861.6s]: healthy
[10859.5s - 10864.7s]: children so I don't think we need
[10861.6s - 10867.9s]: necessarily need to come up with some
[10864.7s - 10870.8s]: incentives right now I I think if we
[10867.9s - 10874.2s]: develop evidence-based
[10870.8s - 10877.9s]: tools that prospective parents can
[10874.2s - 10881.1s]: use to assess their own metabolic MIT
[10877.9s - 10882.7s]: andrial health and more and maybe maybe
[10881.1s - 10886.6s]: more
[10882.7s - 10888.9s]: importantly assess their prospective
[10886.6s - 10892.1s]: Children's
[10888.9s - 10894.4s]: Health and then we pair that with
[10892.1s - 10896.8s]: evidence-based strategies to help them
[10894.4s - 10899.4s]: improve their metabolic
[10896.8s - 10901.6s]: health so that it will improve the
[10899.4s - 10903.3s]: outcomes for those children I mean
[10901.6s - 10905.8s]: that's the Holy
[10903.3s - 10908.9s]: Grail what I just said probably
[10905.8s - 10911.5s]: represents Decades of research
[10908.9s - 10913.1s]: the sooner we get started the better and
[10911.5s - 10914.9s]: some of it's already underway as I've
[10913.1s - 10916.8s]: mentioned so it's not like we start from
[10914.9s - 10921.5s]: Ground Zero people have been on this
[10916.8s - 10925.2s]: Trail for a while um so but it is going
[10921.5s - 10928.1s]: to require a concerted effort it's going
[10925.2s - 10931.8s]: to require massive NIH
[10928.1s - 10934.4s]: funding to support that type of
[10931.8s - 10938.0s]: research we have a new Administration
[10934.4s - 10940.1s]: that is talking about massive disruption
[10938.0s - 10942.2s]: and the way things are
[10940.1s - 10943.5s]: done they're talking about massive
[10942.2s - 10945.9s]: changes at the
[10943.5s - 10949.0s]: NIH I am really hoping and praying that
[10945.9s - 10951.0s]: we're going to see that type of research
[10949.0s - 10953.1s]: as opposed to the current model of
[10951.0s - 10954.8s]: research which focuses on well here's
[10953.1s - 10959.2s]: your
[10954.8s - 10962.4s]: diagnosis schizophrenia or hypertension
[10959.2s - 10965.2s]: and what what new pills can we develop
[10962.4s - 10968.2s]: to treat this condition or how can we
[10965.2s - 10970.3s]: understand this condition it like I I
[10968.2s - 10973.0s]: think we have enough
[10970.3s - 10975.0s]: evidence to be able to really start with
[10973.0s - 10977.0s]: more effective to be able to really
[10975.0s - 10979.2s]: aggressively pursue more effective
[10977.0s - 10980.8s]: treatment and prevention
[10979.2s - 10984.4s]: strategies
[10980.8s - 10986.6s]: fantastic what role do you see yourself
[10984.4s - 10988.6s]: in going forward I mean clearly public
[10986.6s - 10992.7s]: education about these issues related to
[10988.6s - 10995.0s]: metabolic and mitochondrial Health um is
[10992.7s - 10996.6s]: a wonderful home for you in addition to
[10995.0s - 10998.0s]: all your clinical work and and
[10996.6s - 11000.4s]: everything else you're doing this uh
[10998.0s - 11002.8s]: you're clearly very passionate about it
[11000.4s - 11007.8s]: um if I may ask you do you have plans to
[11002.8s - 11009.8s]: get involved in helping the new NIH new
[11007.8s - 11011.6s]: uh Health and Human Services folks you
[11009.8s - 11014.4s]: know Steer in the right direction I am
[11011.6s - 11017.7s]: more than happy to serve as a consultant
[11014.4s - 11020.2s]: if asked and I have I have had some
[11017.7s - 11025.2s]: conversations with a wide range of
[11020.2s - 11028.4s]: people um so I'm more than happy to do
[11025.2s - 11033.2s]: my part I think for the iMed imediate
[11028.4s - 11035.8s]: future honestly I am I'm focused on some
[11033.2s - 11038.3s]: of these lines of research through mlan
[11035.8s - 11041.0s]: hospital and Harvard Medical School I'm
[11038.3s - 11043.3s]: really aggressively working on setting
[11041.0s - 11048.1s]: up a Health
[11043.3s - 11051.2s]: Care System practice to start where we
[11048.1s - 11055.4s]: will treat people with these severe
[11051.2s - 11057.8s]: chronic mental health conditions that I
[11055.4s - 11060.5s]: started a weight list about a year ago
[11057.8s - 11063.9s]: and I have over 5,300 people on my
[11060.5s - 11068.2s]: waiting list wow I can't treat 5,300
[11063.9s - 11071.1s]: people but I have the privilege of a lot
[11068.2s - 11073.8s]: of brilliant clinicians are reaching out
[11071.1s - 11077.7s]: wanting to work with me what I'm hoping
[11073.8s - 11080.4s]: to do is to put into practice into real
[11077.7s - 11083.3s]: world practice everything that we've
[11080.4s - 11086.6s]: talked about and more with real human
[11083.3s - 11089.4s]: beings to demonstrate this really does
[11086.6s - 11092.2s]: work it really does work and I've been
[11089.4s - 11096.1s]: doing this work as a solo
[11092.2s - 11098.6s]: clinician for 30 years now um and I
[11096.1s - 11102.4s]: welcome the opportunity to begin to
[11098.6s - 11103.5s]: develop protocols and processes and use
[11102.4s - 11106.0s]: artificial
[11103.5s - 11109.7s]: intelligence to really try to create
[11106.0s - 11112.5s]: algorithms if we can do that
[11109.7s - 11115.9s]: um then
[11112.5s - 11120.0s]: yeah we hold the potential to help
[11115.9s - 11123.6s]: Millions if not billions of
[11120.0s - 11123.6s]: people and
[11124.1s - 11130.3s]: uh and I you know the theory is
[11127.9s - 11133.8s]: great and I'm really a big fan of the
[11130.3s - 11135.8s]: theory I it continues to line up new
[11133.8s - 11138.2s]: evidence since I've published the book
[11135.8s - 11140.6s]: new evidence has come out just
[11138.2s - 11143.6s]: completely supporting it and if anything
[11140.6s - 11145.0s]: bolstering it putting it into actual
[11143.6s - 11147.0s]: clinical
[11145.0s - 11150.0s]: practice is really where the rubber
[11147.0s - 11151.5s]: Meats rolled Road and um and as we've
[11150.0s - 11154.6s]: just talked about there are so many
[11151.5s - 11156.4s]: things we can do for people who are
[11154.6s - 11160.8s]: suffering today
[11156.4s - 11163.4s]: and uh I'm I'm probably it's not even
[11160.8s - 11166.5s]: probably I'm most excited about that I'm
[11163.4s - 11168.9s]: most excited about training other
[11166.5s - 11171.0s]: clinicians and demonstrating for the
[11168.9s - 11173.6s]: world that this really works that people
[11171.0s - 11175.3s]: can get better from severe treatment
[11173.6s - 11179.2s]: resistant mental
[11175.3s - 11182.4s]: illnesses fantastic well
[11179.2s - 11183.4s]: I and everyone else are super grateful

[11201.5s - 11205.4s]: mental health and physical health and
[11203.6s - 11207.6s]: clarifying for all of us today what you
[11205.4s - 11209.2s]: mean what people mean when they say
[11207.6s - 11211.4s]: metabolic Health we really have to think
[11209.2s - 11213.6s]: about mitochondria what they do the many
[11211.4s - 11217.3s]: many roles they play in cells and are
[11213.6s - 11219.5s]: everywhere in the body and the paths to
[11217.3s - 11222.2s]: improving mitochondrial Health lifestyle
[11219.5s - 11226.2s]: supplement in some cases drug- based you
[11222.2s - 11227.6s]: know um and the preventative care that
[11226.2s - 11229.0s]: we can take especially for people that
[11227.6s - 11230.9s]: are thinking of conceiving children to
[11229.0s - 11234.7s]: get their metabolic Health right but
[11230.9s - 11236.2s]: also of children regardless of age and
